He limited and reduced federal regulations. He put conservatives \u2014 to the tune of over 200 federal judges \u2014 on the lower federal courts and three conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court. He engaged in strong-arm tactics against China. He built part of his wall on the southern border and attempted to reduce, and succeeded in reducing, illegal immigration.\"\n\nForecasting how historians will perceive and treat the 45th president decades from now is a risky endeavor. Perspectives change over time. Yet Perry and other students of politics agree that Trump's trial for inciting insurrection, which begins this week, will likely obscure or taint the most notable accomplishments achieved during his presidency.\n\nOne of his primary distinctions in the history books could be as the only president ever to be formally accused of, and tried for, fomenting rebellion against the government he led.\n\nHistoric proceeding\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives impeached the 74-year-old former president on January 13, charging him with inciting insurrection during an impassioned speech January 6 to supporters before the assault on the Capitol.\n\nTrump's followers wanted to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory. Among the rioters were members of right-wing groups that embrace theories associated with white supremacy.\n\n\"It's a black mark on his record, and if he gets convicted, it's a serious black mark,\" says Susan Low Bloch, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center. \"It'll have a huge significance on his life because he won't be able to run again. It'll have significance for his followers because they won't be able to vote for him. And I think it'll be a warning to future government officials not to engage in insurrections.\""}

Ransomware gangs were shockingly aggressive, targeting health care facilities, schools, and critical infrastructure at an alarming rate. And hackers continued to launch supply chain attacks with extensive fallout. With the pandemic still raging in the background, system administrators, incident responders, global law enforcement, and security practitioners of all sorts worked tirelessly to counter the barrage. And governments scrambled to take more concrete action against online threats.\n\nFor now, though, the seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game continues. As John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, puts it, \"2021 is the year where we're realizing that the problems we chose not to solve years or decades ago are one by one coming back to haunt us.\"\n\nHere's WIRED's retrospective on the year's worst breaches, leaks, data exposures, ransomware attacks, state-sponsored hacking campaigns, and digital mayhem. With no sign of a reprieve in 2022, watch your back and stay safe out there.\n\nIn early May, ransomware hit Colonial Pipeline, which operates a 5,500-mile pipeline that carries nearly half of the East Coast's fuel\u2014gasoline, diesel, and natural gas\u2014from Texas all the way to New Jersey. As a result of the attack, the company shut down portions of the pipeline both to contain the malware and because the attack knocked its billing systems offline. As lines grew at gas stations through the southeastern US, the Department of Transportation released an emergency order to allow expanded fuel distribution by truck. The FBI also named the notorious Russia-linked ransomware gang DarkSide as the perpetrator of the attack.\n\nColonial Pipelines paid a 75 bitcoin ransom\u2014worth more than $4 million at the time\u2014in an attempt to resolve the incident. Law enforcement was later able to recover some of the funds, and DarkSide went underground to avoid scrutiny. In November, the State Department announced a $10 million bounty for substantive information about the group's ringleaders. The attack was one of the largest-ever disruptions of US critical infrastructure by hackers, and was part of a series of alarming hacks in 2021 that finally seem to have served as a wakeup call for the US government and its allies about the need to comprehensively address and deter ransomware attacks."}

Calhoun statue during a deadly riot in Washington, D.C.\n\nAndrew Hatley is the first South Carolinian known to be charged in connection to the riot of Jan. 6. Federal authorities contacted him by phone on Jan. 12, according to a federal complaint, and criminal charges were filed on Jan. 15.\n\nThe complaint charges Hatley with knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority, knowingly impeding government business, engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol buildings.\n\nHe was identified through witnesses, photographs and a cellphone tracking application, according to the federal complaint.\n\nThe complaint does not specify where Hatley is from in South Carolina or his age.\n\nAn attorney was not listed for Hatley in online court records by Tuesday. A working phone number or email for Hatley was not located in public records.\n\nThe federal complaint states that Hatley drove from his residence in South Carolina to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 to attend protests of the presidential election.\n\nA witness called the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the day of the Jan. 6 riot and said they had knowledge and photos of Hatley inside the Capitol, the complaint states.\n\nThe FBI's Columbia field office spokesperson, Agent Don Wood, said the local office did not have any \"substantial involvement\" in investigating Hatley.\n\nWood declined to comment on whether the office was pursuing any additional South Carolina residents for potential charges connected to the Capitol riot.\n\nFive people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including a Capitol police officer. Many were injured, and more than 200 have since been charged in connection to the chaos, according to national media reports and the FBI.\n\nThe breach of the Capitol building temporarily halted the certification of electoral votes by Congress to formally ratify Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. Biden is to be inaugurated on Jan. 20.\n\nHatley had used an application on his cellphone while in the Capitol to track his location, according to the complaint. The FBI obtained Hatley's phone number and verified Hatley's whereabouts on Jan. 6 through the \"Life360\" location-tracking app.\n\nA second witness gave several photographs to the FBI that the witness had obtained from Hatley, according to the complaint.\n\nOne of the photographs shows Hatley in a green respirator mask in front of a statue of John C. Calhoun, the politician from South Carolina who served as the nation's vice president under presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. The statue is inside the center section of the U.S. Capitol building known as the crypt, which was damaged during the riot, according to media reports.\n\nThe FBI also reviewed a Facebook page that showed Hatley denied any involvement in breaching the Capitol.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the post read, \"It has come to my attention that there was someone who looks like me at the Capitol. I'd like to set the record straight. I don't have that kind of motivation for lost causes. I just don't care enough anymore, certainly not enough for all that.\"\n\nA Facebook page referenced in the federal complaint had been taken down by this week.\n\nA screenshot of the Facebook page that's been circulating on social media shows Hatley as working for a trucking company in Newberry. A woman who answered the phone at the company Tuesday declined to comment.\n\nWhen FBI agents contacted Hatley by phone on Jan. 12, Hatley said he was not sure how much he should say without legal counsel because \"he could be in a great deal of trouble,\" according to the complaint."}

Phil Murphy said. At least 13 people were killed in New York City, police said, 11 of them in flooded basement apartments, which often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nation's most expensive housing markets. Suburban Westchester County reported three deaths.\n\nOfficials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.\n\nSophy Liu said she tried using towels and garbage bags to stop the water coming into her first-floor New York City apartment, but the flood rose to her chest in just a half hour. She roused her son from bed, put him in a life jacket and inflatable swimming ring and tried to flee, but the door stuck. She called two friends who helped her jar it loose.\n\n\"I was obviously scared, but I had to be strong for my son. I had to calm him down,\" she recalled Thursday as medical examiners removed three bodies from a home down her Queens street.\n\nIn another part of Queens, water rapidly filled Deborah Torres' first-floor apartment to her knees as her landlord frantically urged her neighbors below \u2014 among them a toddler \u2014 to get out, she said. But the water rushed in so strongly that she surmised they weren't able to open the door. The three residents died.\n\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"How can something like this happen?\"\n\nIda's soggy remnants merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change \u2014 warmer air holds more rain \u2014 and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center had warned since Tuesday of the potential for \"significant and life-threatening flash flooding\" and major river flooding in the mid-Atlantic region and New England.\n\nStill, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the storm's strength took them by surprise.\n\n\"We did not know that between 8:50 and 9:50 p.m. last night, that the heavens would literally open up and bring Niagara Falls level of water to the streets of New York,\" said Hochul, a Democrat who became governor last week after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned."}

Authorities did not have any immediate information on injuries.\n\nOther video showed water rushing through Newark Liberty International Airport as the storm moved into New York on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, tweeted at 10:30 p.m. that all flights were suspended and all parking lots were closed due to severe flooding. All train service to the airport also was suspended.\n\nThe National Weather Service recorded 3.15 inches of rain in New York's Central Park in one hour, far surpassing the 1.94 inches that fell in one hour during Tropical Storm Henri on the night of Aug. 21, which was believed at the time to be the most ever recorded in the park.\n\nNew York's FDR Drive, a major artery on the east side of Manhattan, was underwater by late evening and subway stations and tracks became so flooded that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended all service. Videos posted online showed subway riders standing on seats in cars filled with water.\n\nOther videos showed vehicles submerged up to their windows on major roadways in and around the city and garbage floating down a street in Queens.\n\nAt the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Queens, television footage showed fans who had watched matches under the Arthur Ashe Stadium's retractable roof slogging through several inches of water as they left.\n\nFew parts of the region were untouched, and residents huddled inside and endured the anxiety brought on by tornado warnings that gradually moved north and east with the storm.\n\nThe roof collapsed at the Postal Service building in Kearny, New Jersey, with people inside, police Sgt. Chris Levchak said. Rescue crews were on scene into the night, with no immediate word on the number of people or severity of injuries.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in all of New Jersey's 21 counties, urging people to stay off the flooded roads. Meteorologists warned that rivers likely won't crest for a few more days, raising the possibility of more widespread flooding.\n\nSoaking rains prompted the evacuations of thousands of people after water reached dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, a Pennsylvania town nicknamed Flood City.\n\nIda caused countless school and business closures in Pennsylvania. About 150 roadways maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were closed and many smaller roadways also were impassable. Several thousand customers were still without power late Wednesday night.\n\nSome areas near Johnstown, whose history includes several deadly floods, saw 5 inches or more of rain by mid-afternoon, an inundation that triggered an evacuation order for those downstream from the Wilmore dam. Nearby Hinckston Run Dam was also being monitored but appeared stable by late afternoon.\n\nBoth dams were considered high-hazard dams that are likely to kill someone were they to fail.\n\nEvacuees were taken to a nearby high school with help from the Red Cross, National Guard, local transit authority and school transportation services, he said.\n\nThe 1889 Johnstown flood killed 2,200 people, a disaster blamed on poor maintenance on the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River. It sent a 36-foot wall of water roaring into a populated area at 40 mph (65 kph).\n\nHigh water drove some from their homes in Maryland and Virginia. The storm killed a teenager, two people were not accounted for and a tornado was believed to have touched down along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.\n\nThe National Weather Service had predicted flooding from what remained of Hurricane Ida, saying steep terrain and even city streets were particularly vulnerable to a band of severe weather that extended from the Appalachians into Massachusetts."}

This came as little surprise to anyone who watched the trial with an open mind.\n\nRegardless of one's thoughts on the wisdom of a 17-year-old arming himself to defend the livelihoods of strangers, Rittenhouse had strong claims of lawful self-defense, and conviction seemed like an uphill battle for the state from the outset.\n\nAnd yet, countless blue-check pundits on social media immediately lost their collective minds in a race-baiting game of \"What if Rittenhouse was black?\"\n\nTheir presumptive implication is that Rittenhouse's acquittal was based entirely on his race. Several highly followed commentators went so far as to explicitly assert that no person of color could ever intentionally shoot someone with a gun he or she carried in public and be acquitted on grounds of lawful self-defense.\n\nThe idea that self-defense is a legal justification largely for white Americans and that no jury would ever acquit defendants of color who claim they acted in self-defense is not just overly reductive, it's absurd.\n\nIt's also easily disprovable with a basic Google search.\n\nConsider just some of the many non-white defendants who were acquitted of murder or attempted murder charges in recent years because juries determined they acted in lawful self-defense:\n\nTony Bristol \u2014A jury acquitted Bristol on all charges related to a confrontation during which he fatally shot one man and wounded another.

Some creditors promptly returned $400 million of the mistakenly wired money, but 10 others refused to return $500 million. The dispute ended up in court.\n\nYesterday, unexpectedly, a New York federal judge said the firms could keep the cash, despite acknowledging that the money had been transferred in error.\n\nWait, what? The lenders argued that the transfers matched what they were owed, so they could have \"reasonably thought the payments were intentional,\" assuming that it would be \"downright irrational\" for Citi to make such a big mistake, the judge, Jesse Furman, concluded. He might have ruled differently if he could \"write on a blank slate,\" but there were legal precedents supporting the defendants.\n\n\"New York law wants to discourage banks from making these kinds of mistakes,\" said Adam Abensohn of Quinn Emanuel, who represented the asset managers. \"It's one thing to mistakenly send money to someone with no entitlement to that payment,\" he told DealBook. \"But there is nothing unfair about keeping that money when it's owed.\"\n\n\"At its heart, this case involves a clash between two basic intuitive principles,\" the judge said:\n\n\"If one party sends money to another by mistake, the latter should generally be required to give it back.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, if one party owes money to another and pays that money back to the penny, the latter should generally be allowed to keep and use the money as it wishes, without fear that the former will develop a case of borrower's remorse and claim that the payment was by mistake.\"\n\nWhere do you stand? The decision \u2014 which Citi will probably appeal \u2014 raises thorny questions about rules versus principles:\n\nSince it was a mistake by the bank, why not return the money?\n\nWhat responsibility do creditors have to the bank if it pays them back early?\n\nThis has generated a fascinating debate here at DealBook, and we'd like to hear what you think: Email us at dealbook@nytimes.com.

Especially if any civil cases are filed against him.\n\n\"It's never good to have a witness or client go out and make more statements than they need to because ultimately those statements can be turned around and used against them because you never know where litigation might lead to down the road,\" Kim said. \"So I personally don't think it's a great idea for him to continue doing interviews and seen out there but those are some of the dangers that are you have when you're involved in a high profile case that Mr. Richards was hinting at.\"\n\nLegal experts say if Rittenhouse profits off his notoriety from the case, it increases the likelihood he will be the target of lawsuits from those impacted by the night of August 25, 2020."}

The centerpiece of the law was an emergency payment to over 150 million American households that needed help.\n\nCongress used a simple filter to determine who was eligible for assistance: The full $1,200 was limited to single taxpayers who'd reported $75,000 a year or less in income on their previous tax return. Married couples got $2,400 if they had reported less than $150,000 in income. Money was sent automatically to those who qualified.\n\nIra Rennert, worth $3.7 billion according to Forbes, did not appear to need the cash infusion offered by the CARES Act. After all, his 62,000-square-foot Hamptons home is one of the largest in the country, so he was unlikely to get cabin fever during lockdown, let alone have trouble buying food. Nevertheless, Rennert, who made his fortune as a corporate raider in the '80s and '90s, got a $2,400 check from the government.\n\nGeorge Soros, the prominent hedge fund manager and philanthropist who's worth $8.6 billion, didn't need the CARES cash, either. Neither did his son, Robert, himself worth hundreds of millions. But they, too, both got checks. (Both returned the checks, according to their representatives.)\n\nProPublica, using its trove of IRS records, identified at least 18 billionaires who received stimulus payments, which were funded by U.S. taxpayers, in the spring of 2020. Hundreds of other ultrawealthy taxpayers also got checks.\n\nThe wealthy taxpayers who received the stimulus checks got them because they came in under the government's income threshold. In fact, they reported way less taxable income than that \u2014 even hundreds of millions less \u2014 after they used business write-offs to wipe out their gains.\n\nProPublica found 270 taxpayers who collectively disclosed $5.7 billion in income, according to their previous tax return, but who were able to deploy deductions at such a massive scale that they qualified for stimulus checks. All listed negative net incomes on tax returns.\n\nConsider two stimulus recipients with similarly huge incomes in 2018. Timothy Headington is an oil mogul, real estate developer and executive producer of such films as \"Argo\" and \"World War Z,\" and he's worth $1.4 billion. He had $62 million in income in 2018, but after $342 million in write-offs, his final result was negative $280 million. The same was true of Rennert, whose $64 million in income that year was erased by $355 million in deductions, for a final total of negative $291 million.\n\nFigures like these reveal a basic truth about the U.S. income tax system. Most people earn the overwhelming majority of their income via wages and take deductions where they can. But the income of the ultrawealthy as revealed on their taxes tells, at best, a partial story. As ProPublica reported earlier this year, the wealthiest taxpayers often have great flexibility in when and how they take taxable income, allowing them to pay a minuscule portion of their wealth growth in taxes. For the ultrawealthy, wages are to be avoided, carrying as they do the burden of not only income tax but also of payroll taxes.\n\nWages rarely made up a significant portion of income for the 270 wealthy stimulus check recipients identified by ProPublica. In total, only $82 million, or 1.4%, of the $5.7 billion in income taken in by the group came in the form of wages.\n\nThe ultrawealthy have other tax advantages. Many can tap a particularly generous vein of deductions: businesses they own. These can wipe out all of their income, even for years to come, unlike other deductions, like those for charitable giving. Certain industries, like real estate or oil and gas, are a well-known source of tax benefits that can generate paper losses even for a successful business."}

This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known.\n\nCurrent knowledge about Omicron\n\nResearchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.\n\nTransmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.\n\nSeverity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students\u2014younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease\u2014but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.\n\nEffectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.\n\nEffectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.\n\nEffectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.\n\nEffectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant.\n\nStudies underway\n\nAt the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments."}

Andrew Cuomo's feet to the fire for his handling of the coronavirus in the early months of the pandemic, when the Democratic governor regularly appeared on his brother's CNN program for friendly interviews.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said that the state Department of Health underreported COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50%, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nCuomo famously directed nursing homes in the Empire State to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. The decision created an onslaught of COVID-19 cases that infected thousands of elderly patients and resulted in hundreds of deaths among the state's most vulnerable population. He eventually reversed the decision \u2013 but thousands had died from COVID-19 in New York nursing homes before Cuomo reversed course.\n\nNY UNDERCOUNTED NURSING HOME CORONAVIRUS DEATHS BY AS MUCH AS 50%, STATE AG SAYS\n\nAround the same time, Cuomo made regular appearances on \"Cuomo Prime Time,\" a CNN program hosted by his younger brother, Chris. The siblings conducted a series of playful on-air conversations masquerading as interviews as Americans wanted answers from the elder Cuomo amid the nursing home scandal.\n\nInstead, the CNN host joked around with his brother about things such as who is their mother's favorite child. Days after Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff, he appeared on his brother's show for a 25-minute sit-down that made no mention of the nursing home death toll.\n\nThere was only one mention of nursing homes during the entire interview, which was when Andrew Cuomo was boasting about the state's increased coronavirus testing capabilities and listed nursing homes and prisons among the sites that they had been administered.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO DOES PROP COMEDY WITH NY GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, FAILS TO ASK ABOUT NURSING-HOME CONTROVERSY\n\nDuring one infamous segment, the Cuomo brothers turned to physical comedy after the CNN anchor played a clip of the governor taking a coronavirus test where a nurse placed a cotton swab up his nostril.\n\n\"Is it true that this was the swab that the nurse was actually using on you?\" the primetime host asked his brother while holding a cartoonishly oversized cotton swab.\n\nHe then quickly followed by presenting him an even larger cotton swab, asking the governor if that was the one the nurse used on him.\n\nCornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson blasted CNN following the prop comedy routine by the Cuomo siblings.\n\nCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO FINALLY ASKS BROTHER SOFTBALL QUESTION ON NY NURSING HOME CONTROVERSY\n\n\"CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,\" Jacobson told Fox News at the time.\n\n\"This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,\" Jacobson added. \"Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.\"\n\nDespite widespread criticism, CNN continued to allow the Cuomo brothers to chat on air. In June, CNN's Cuomo finally mentioned the nursing home controversy to his brother after ignoring it during at least 10 on-air interviews since the scandal began.\n\n\"Nursing homes. People died there, they didn't have to, it was mismanaged and the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?\" the CNN anchor asked after months of ignoring the topic.\n\n\"Several statements that are not correct, but that's OK. It's your show, you say whatever you want to say,\" Gov. Cuomo jokingly reacted.\n\nGOV. ANDREW CUOMO GETS A PASS FROM CNN ON NURSING HOME POLICY CONTROVERSY\n\nThe governor then called the nursing home deaths \"the most tragic situation\" and pointed to how there were nursing home deaths \"all across the country\" and said \"we have to figure out how to do it better the next time\" before the next virus wave occurs."}

At one point, 18-year-old Rittenhouse broke down in tears while on the stand.\n\n\"If I would have let Mr. Rosenbaum take my firearm from me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably killed more people,\" he testified.\n\nRittenhouse referred to the other people he shot at as part of a \"mob\" chasing him, telling the court Huber came at him, struck him with a skateboard, and grabbed his gun. Rittenhouse shot him once in the chest, killing him. Finally, he said he saw Grosskreutz lunge at him and point a pistol at his head, so Rittenhouse shot him, he testified.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Richards told reporters Friday in his mind, 'it wasn't a close call' whether to put Rittenhouse on the stand.\n\n\"We had a mock jury and we did two different juries, one with him testifying and one without him testifying. It was substantially better when he testified... and that sealed it,\" Richards said. \"If you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose, period.\"\n\nHis testimony was key for several reasons, according to legal experts.\n\n\"Number one, you humanize him... More important, number two, he explained his uses of force,\" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said.\n\nRittenhouse's testimony gave jurors the ability to hear what he thought at the time and whether he believed he was in danger \u2013 a claim the prosecution, ultimately failed to undermine, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.\n\n\"They (prosecutors) pointed out some sort of minor inconsistencies and things he said on the night of, and said later, but nothing that undermines sort of the core defense argument, which was, he was attacked,\" Honig told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday. \"Every time he shot, he was attacked.\"\n\n\"The prosecution did not make enough of a dent in Kyle Rittenhouse,\" Honig added.\n\nState did not prove Rittenhouse provoked violence\n\nWhat the trial came down to, according to civil rights attorney Charles F. Coleman Jr. were two competing narratives: one of Rittenhouse being a victim who was attacked, and one of being a vigilante who provoked the violence.\n\n\"The jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim, they thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim,\" he said."}

A cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, was shot dead, and a director, Joel Souza, was injured due to \u2013 by many accounts, including those detailed in an affidavit filed by a detective from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office \u2013 a lack of diligence on set.\n\nCould that have happened on my watch?\n\nFor more than 20 years, I led the prop department of the \"Saturday Night Live\" film unit and coped with grueling days, cramped schedules and demanding bosses. During our most difficult moments, I reminded my team that this was fun, a form of make-believe for grownups, an honorable and blessed craft.\n\nWe had to stay alert and persist. Sometimes I'd joke, sometimes I'd yell, but it was always about keeping our collective eye on the ball, about our shared pride in the tiny movie we were making for a show on national TV. Call this cheerleading if you like, but it worked, along with the support of attentive producers.\n\nOur assistant director began each morning with a safety meeting to outline the challenges of the day. This too brought us together. Confidence breeds confidence, and when we feel confident, we tend to work well.\n\nIn my view, a sense of shared purpose must have been lacking on the set of \"Rust.\" We don't yet know all the details of what occurred during this shoot, so we can't draw firm conclusions about what led to that terrible Thursday. (\"We will continue to fully cooperate with any and all law-enforcement investigations as they work through the details of this heartbreaking tragedy,\" a spokesperson for the production company behind the movie told CNN.)\n\nBut if multiple media reports, citing accounts from people who were working on the set, reflect the truth, days ran long, proper accommodations weren't provided and morale was low.\n\nA source close to the production told CNN there was a \"full safety meeting\" the day of the accident. But David Halls, the assistant director on \"Rust\" who handed Alec Baldwin the gun that fired the fatal shot, told investigators that he did not check all the rounds loaded in the weapon, a detective wrote in a search warrant affidavit made public Wednesday.\n\nTwo people who worked closely with Halls during productions in 2019 told CNN that he was previously accused of a disregard for safety protocols.\n\nThe woman who acted as armorer on the movie, Hannah Gutierrez, was 24 years old and had recently completed only her first job as head armorer on a film."}

Bernie Sanders of Vermont pushed, without success, for a Senate vote on $2,000 stimulus checks Friday as the clock winds down on the 116th Congress.\n\nEfforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Sanders to secure a vote on increasing the direct payment amounts that Americans under a certain income level receive were blocked by Senate Republicans, who have largely argued that increasing stimulus checks to $2,000 would not be the kind of \"targeted relief\" necessary to respond to the economic distress caused by the pandemic, despite the fact that President Donald Trump has called for that amount.\n\nSchumer took to the Senate floor, saying, \"The Senate can start off this new year by adding to that sense of hope by sending $2,000 checks to struggling American families.\" He then pushed for a vote on $2,000 checks, but was blocked when a GOP senator objected.\n\nThe House of Representatives on Monday passed a measure to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 after the President championed the effort, sending the bill to the Senate where its future has been less certain. Time for action is running out. The 117th Congress will convene on Sunday.\n\nThe legislation's approval in the House came after Trump signed a sweeping coronavirus relief bill into law Sunday evening. That measure, which was negotiated on a bipartisan basis, provides for $600 in direct payments, but after a deal was brokered and passed out of Congress, Trump railed against the amount as too low and called for $2,000 checks instead, which House Democrats seized upon to push for an increase.\n\n\"I'll ask consent for the final time that the Senate set a time for a vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks. I've done it every day this week. This is it \u2013 the last chance for the 116th Congress to pass $2,000 checks and to say to regular Americans that help is on the way. Let's have a vote,\" Schumer said."}

Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas \u2013 mostly in critical infrastructure - that are \"off limits\" for cyber-attacks.\n\nRansomware has long posed a cybersecurity threat to companies and infrastructure, but experts say the problem has exploded in recent years. Last year was especially egregious, with ransomware victims in the US paying out nearly $350m, according to the global security group the Institute for Security and Technology \u2013 a 311% increase over 2019.\n\nThe FBI director, Christopher Wray, highlighted this startling figure at a congressional hearing. \"Ransomware alone, the total volume of amounts paid in ransomware has tripled over the last year,\" Wray said. \"We think the cyber threat is increasing almost exponentially.\"\n\nExperts attribute the surge to a number of factors, but they say one of the most critical has been the shift to remote working during the pandemic.\n\n\"When you are working from home, you are not behind the castle walls any more,\" said John Hammond, a cybersecurity researcher at the security firm Huntress. \"You are working with your own devices, away from the safe perimeter of corporate networks.\"\n\nCriminals have found an increasingly lucrative path in ransomware attacks, in which a hacker breaks into a company or government's network and seizes data or systems, demanding payment for their return. Employees on computers outside the safety of office networks face more risks. Company networks generally only allow trusted devices to connect, reducing the risk of outside actors or malware entering. They also often have stronger protections in place than the average consumer wifi network.\n\n\"The transition that we're seeing to working from home has contributed dramatically to the rise in successful ransomware attacks,\" said Israel Barak, the chief information security officer at the security firm Cybereason. \"There are a lot more open doors to access networks now that employees are working remotely.\"\n\nOne of the most consequential ransomware hacks in recent months, on the Colonial Pipeline \u2013 which shut down systems that supply 45% of the eastern United States' fuel \u2013 has now been attributed to the breach of a virtual private network, commonly used by remote employees to connect to a company system.\n\nVPNs are the most secure way for employees to connect to a corporate network from home, but they can pose their own risks if they are out of date or do not use multi-factor authentication.\n\nA spokesman for Colonial Pipeline said the VPN that was compromised was an older model and not the VPN that employees were actively using to remotely access the Colonial network.\n\nBut experts say any time employees work offsite using their own networks, risks are involved. There have been a number of documented attacks on companies carried out through VPN access since the pandemic began, including on the Japanese game developer Capcom and a European industrial firm.\n\nIn June 2020, the justice department identified a Russian ransomware group that was deliberately targeting people who work from home during the pandemic to access corporate and government networks.\n\nCorporate and government offices have a number of measures in place meant to keep bad actors out, said Joseph Carson, the chief security scientist at the cloud security firm Thycotic. That includes secure internet routers with unique passwords, firewalls that monitor incoming traffic and keep out threats, and company devices with additional security in place.\n\n\"Most of those protections are pretty much useless when the devices have been moved to the public internet,\" he said.\n\nThough not a ransomware attack, the hack of Twitter in 2020 July was more directly attributed to remote working. Hackers called several Twitter employees claiming to be IT department employees and offered to help connect through the company's virtual private network being used by employees working from home. The 17-year-old hacker behind that heist collected $117,000 in bitcoin from the attack.\n\nSecurity breaches at large have also been on the rise over the past year. The vast majority of IT teams \u2013 82% \u2013 experienced an increase in cyber-attacks in 2020, according to a survey from security firm Sophos."}

The crisis surrounding his brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has deepened amid another accusation of sexual harassment\u2014the third account in a span of days, this time corroborated with a photo. As such, Chris Cuomo felt the need to address the unfolding scandal on-air. \"Obviously I am aware of what is going on with my brother.

But the statement came after Cuomo had covered his brother for months starting in the early days of New York's battle with COVID-19, and without a shred of purported objectivity. Last spring, viewers were drawn to the act that was the Cuomo brothers, boosting New York's governor to celebrity status for his relatively sane handling of the pandemic. The pairing was such a conflict of interest that, as the New York Times' Ben Smith previously reported, it required CNN to roll back a rule they'd instituted in late 2013 when an interview between the Cuomos raised similar questions about ethics. At the time, the network told the host he could no longer interview his brother on television.\n\nWhile the reversal was a questionable decision\u2014and one CNN quickly came under fire for\u2014allowing the brothers their recurring shtick, complete with familial banter and praise for the governor's leadership, packed an emotional punch that some, including Chris Cuomo himself, argued audiences craved in the early days of the pandemic. \"I wanted people to see that he's not just super-intense on this all the time\u2014that he's living it with you,\" the host said on his SiriusXM radio show at the end of March, noting his brother is \"not a general\" but \"a man in full\" while also acknowledging \"there will come a time when there's an accountability measure where it will no longer make sense for it to be me\" interviewing him."}

Well, already, two of the Rust EPs are wiping their hands clean of the situation.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the now shuttered production, Allen Cheney made it known in a statement provided to the press Wednesday that he, along with Emily Salveson and her Streamline Global finance company, \"received Executive Producer credit on the film Rust having no involvement with the physical and day to day production,\" which is \"consistent with financing partners across productions of all sizes.\"\n\n(L-R) DP Halyna Hutchins on left who was died on set of 'Rust', director/writer Joel Souza who was injured and star/producer Alec Baldwin ICFC; Mega\n\nCheney further defended the experience of the producers of the production, which saw Baldwin on October 21 discharge a long Colt .45 revolver during a \"quick draw\" rehearsal, with a \"live round\" striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza, according to police. Baldwin, who also serves as a producer on Rust, was informed by First Assistant Director Dave Halls that he had been given what's known as a \"cold gun.\" That was not the case, as the death of Hutchins and injuring of the film's director Joel Souza in the shoulder that afternoon tragically revealed.\n\n\"The six credited producers on the independent film Rust, Ryan Smith, Alec Baldwin, Nathan Klingher, Ryan Winterstern, Matt DelPiano and Anjul Nigam, collectively have more than 35 years' experience producing small to mid-level film and television projects,\" said Cheney's statement.\n\n\"Rust is a union-certified production, in good standing with all of the major production unions and guilds, including IATSE, the Teamsters, SAG, and DGA,\" said Cheney.

We've learned that the production finance lender, whose feature credits include the upcoming Bruce Willis-John Travolta re-team Paradise City, loaned money to production against distribution collateral. Bondit did not respond for comment on this story.\n\nRust was not bonded. Two of the three U.S. completion bond firms were approached about bonding the project, according to sources, but it didn't happen. In one of the two cases, a potential financier made inquiries with one and stepped back from the film when the company declined to issue a bond.\n\nBondit generally does not require completion bonds to lend and has been active in getting productions up and running during Covid.\n\nBonds are like super-insurance, with the bond company on the hook for costs if a film isn't delivered in time and on budget.

His four-year tenure in the White House revealed extraordinary fissures in American society but left little doubt that he is a figure unlike any other in the nation's history.\n\nTrump, the New York businessman and former reality TV show star, won the 2016 election after a campaign that defied norms and commanded public attention from the moment it began. His approach to governing was equally unconventional.\n\nOther presidents tried to unify the nation after turning from the campaign trail to the White House. From his first days in Washington to his last, Trump seemed to revel in the political fight. He used his presidential megaphone to criticize a long list of perceived adversaries, from the news media to members of his own administration, elected officials in both political parties and foreign heads of state. The more than 26,000 tweets he sent as president provided an unvarnished, real-time account of his thinking on a broad spectrum of issues and eventually proved so provocative that Twitter permanently banned him from its platform. In his final days in office, Trump became the first president ever to be impeached twice \u2013 the second time for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol during the certification of the election he lost \u2013 and the nation's first chief executive in more than 150 years to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration.\n\nTrump's policy record included major changes at home and abroad. He achieved a string of long-sought conservative victories domestically, including the biggest corporate tax cuts on record, the elimination of scores of environmental regulations and a reshaping of the federal judiciary. In the international arena, he imposed tough new immigration restrictions, withdrew from several multilateral agreements, forged closer ties with Israel and launched a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China as part of a wider effort to address what he saw as glaring imbalances in America's economic relationship with other countries.\n\nMany questions about Trump's legacy and his role in the nation's political future will take time to answer. But some takeaways from his presidency are already clear from Pew Research Center's studies in recent years. In this essay, we take a closer look at a few of the key societal shifts that accelerated \u2013 or emerged for the first time \u2013 during the tenure of the 45th president.\n\nHow we did this This examination of how the United States changed during Donald Trump's presidency is based on an analysis of public opinion survey data from Pew Research Center, administrative data from government agencies, news reports and other sources. Links to the original sources of data \u2013 including the field dates, sample sizes and methodologies of individual surveys by the Center \u2013 are included wherever possible. Unless otherwise noted, all references to Republicans and Democrats in this analysis include independents who lean to each party.\n\nDeeply partisan and personal divides\n\nTrump's status as a political outsider, his outspoken nature and his willingness to upend past customs and expectations of presidential behavior made him a constant focus of public attention, as well as a source of deep partisan divisions.\n\nEven before he took office, Trump divided Republicans and Democrats more than any incoming chief executive in the prior three decades. The gap only grew more pronounced after he became president. An average of 86% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of the job over the course of his tenure, compared with an average of just 6% of Democrats \u2013 the widest partisan gap in approval for any president in the modern era of polling. Trump's overall approval rating never exceeded 50% and fell to a low of just 29% in his final weeks in office, shortly after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats weren't just divided over Trump's handling of the job. They also interpreted many aspects of his character and personality in fundamentally opposite ways. In a 2019 survey, at least three-quarters of Republicans said the president's words sometimes or often made them feel hopeful, entertained, informed, happy and proud. Even larger shares of Democrats said his words sometimes or often made them feel concerned, exhausted, angry, insulted and confused."}

In February, the Republican-led Senate voted not to remove him from office. After that, impeachment mostly disappeared from national discourse, barely playing a role in the presidential election, even though it was a historic moment and the idea was stunningly popular, and even though it involved Trump's attempt to scuttle the campaign of Joe Biden, who ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee. But views on Trump were already largely ossified, and besides, there was the pandemic and an economic crisis to deal with.\n\nThe memory of impeachment is back with a vengeance this week. Though Biden beat Trump, the president continues to try to overturn Biden's victory. In a phone call on Saturday that was eerily reminiscent of Trump's July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump tried to pressure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia (the state, not the country) to do something, anything, to throw the state's results back to him.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump won't just violate the rules again\u2014he's already doing it\n\nDuring impeachment, Trump's critics, including me, warned repeatedly that if he were not impeached and removed, he'd feel empowered to commit the same offenses again. Trump's current, shambling coup attempt is the price of the Senate's failure to remove him.\n\nRaffensperger, who seems understandably furious over Trump's pressure campaign against him, taped the conversation and then released it to The Washington Post after Trump lied about it on Twitter. The president's MO has not changed since July 2019\u2014in fact, it has scarcely changed over the course of his career. All the hallmarks of the Zelensky call popped up in the Saturday coup call. Trump alternates between wheedling flattery and domineering (though vague) threats. He suggests that Raffensperger owes him one\u2014aren't they on the same team? He presents a proposed miscarriage of justice as a vindication of justice. Just as he did with Zelensky, Trump runs through a litany of wild and false conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump speaks like a mob boss, making his desire clear but never saying explicitly what he wants, so as to maintain deniability. What he says is, \"So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\" What he means is, Find some way to throw out valid votes so that I can win. (Never mind that the state's results have been certified and its electors seated; Raffensperger's role has concluded.)"}

The first batch, amounting to 600,000 payments, went out Aug. 27, and the second batch, on Sept. 17, was much larger, with at least 2 million Californians receiving the benefit. Approximately two-thirds of California taxpayers are eligible for a payment of $600, and some qualifying families will receive an additional $500.\n\nThese state-only checks are part of the $100 billion \"California Comeback Plan\" aimed at providing immediate relief to families and business that've been the most negatively impacted by the pandemic. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office called it \"the biggest state tax rebate in American history.\"\n\nRead on to find out if you'll be getting a Golden State Stimulus II check, what you need to do to get your money, and when your check could arrive. Also, here's everything you need to know about the 2021 child tax credit, which is providing the vast majority of families across the US with advance monthly checks to help cover expenses and basic necessities.\n\nDo I qualify for a $600 or $1,100 payment?\n\nThe Golden State Stimulus II payments are different from the Golden State Stimulus I payments that went out earlier this year. GSS I payments -- a one-time check of either $600 or $1,200 -- went out to those who typically earned less than $30,000 and received the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, or CalEITC, or those who filed their taxes with an Individual Tax Identification Number, or ITIN.\n\nGSS II has been expanded so that more Californians qualify. You're eligible for a $600 payment if you've been a California resident for more than half of the 2020 tax year (you must still be a California resident on the date the payment is issued). You need to also meet the following requirements:\n\nYou filed your 2020 taxes by Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nYour California Adjusted Gross Income, or CA AGI, was $75,000 or less for the 2020 tax year.\n\nYou cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.\n\nIf you don't qualify for GSS II, see if you might be eligible for GSS I. Californians who received the earlier GSS I payment could be eligible for a GSS II check for $500 or $1,000 only if they claimed a qualifying child or relative as a dependent on their 2020 tax return.\n\nBesides those who already received GSS I and have no dependents, there are others who are excluded from GSS II payments. Californians whose income is exclusively from other benefits, like Social Security, CalWorks, unemployment or state disability, do not qualify. For more information, check out the Franchise Tax Board's help page.\n\nWatch this: Child tax credit: Everything we know 04:17\n\nHow much money will I get?\n\nFor most Californians who qualify, you do not need to do anything to receive GSS II other than file your 2020 tax return. If you still need to file, you can find different options for filing online, on paper or in person before the deadline on Oct. 15,\n\nIf you'd like to see if you qualify, or estimate the amount of your GSS II, you can go to the Franchise Tax Board estimator. If you have a Social Security number and meet all the GSS II requirements above, you should receive $600 if you had no dependents, and $1,100 if you claimed at least one dependent. Note that some of the payment amounts change depending on whether you received GSS I, whether you have an SSN or ITIN and if you are married filing separately.\n\nWhen will my stimulus payment be sent?\n\nCalifornia's stimulus payments are going out twice a month, or about every two weeks, though some may go out earlier or later. Those who qualify and have already set up direct deposit when filing their 2020 tax return can expect an electronic payment.\n\nMost direct deposit stimulus payments will be issued before Oct. 31. If you filed a state tax return after Sept. 1, you might have to wait at least 45 days for the return to be processed and have a check issued."}

Treasury and IRS are working tirelessly to make that happen,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nHow much will you get?\n\nThe payments are worth up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. So a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will now receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nThe full amount goes to individuals earning less than $75,000 of adjusted gross income, heads of households (like single parents) earning less than $112,500 and married couples earning less than $150,000. But then the payments gradually phase out as income goes up.\n\nDo you make too much money to be eligible?\n\nIndividuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 will be completely cut off from the third round of stimulus payments \u2013 regardless of how many children they have.\n\nOn what year are the income limits based?\n\nThe income thresholds will be based on a taxpayer's most recent return. If they've already filed a 2020 return by the time the payment is sent, the IRS will base eligibility on their 2020 adjusted gross income. If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of Biden signing the bill \u2013 which is expected to happen soon after the House votes on Wednesday on the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first, because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nThe IRS is \"building on lessons learned from previous rounds to increase the households that will get electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks,\" Psaki said.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check. Will you get this one?"}

Please refer to revised SAGE Prioritization Roadmap for the latest recommendations.\n\nThe World Health Organization, with the support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, continues to review the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of a booster dose for the currently available COVID-19 vaccines which have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). This statement reflects the current understanding of vaccine performance and supply as presented to SAGE on 7 December 2021. It summarizes and contextualizes current evidence on booster vaccination. In recent weeks the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant has emerged. Data are currently insufficient to assess the impact of this new variant of concern on vaccine effectiveness, in particular against severe disease. The statements and conclusions in this document will therefore be updated as data become available.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nThe following definitions and terminology are used by WHO throughout its policy recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination. This note focuses only on booster doses.\n\nBooster doses are administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of EUL COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population. The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient.\n\nare administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of EUL COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population. The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient. The objective of an additional dose in the primary series is to enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immunocompromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series with some vaccines (1).\n\nGlobal context\n\nThe Director-General of WHO has called for a moratorium on booster vaccination for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to counter the persisting and profound inequity in global vaccine access (2). While many countries are far from reaching the 40% coverage target by the end of 2021, other countries have vaccinated well beyond this threshold, already reaching children and implementing extensive booster vaccination programmes. At the time of release of this statement, globally about 20% of COVID-19 vaccine doses, daily, are used for booster or additional dose vaccination."}

(AP) \u2014 The land on which Audrey Trufant Salvant's home sits in the small Louisiana town of Ironton has become an island in a sea of mud and snake-infested marsh grass. Nearby houses are disconnected from their foundations, a refrigerator is lodged sideways in a tree, and dozens of caskets and tombs from two nearby cemeteries are strewn across lawns for blocks. The entire town is without power and running water.\n\nA month after Hurricane Ida roared ashore with 150-mph (241-kph) winds, communities all along the state's southeastern coast \u2014 Ironton, Grand Isle, Houma, Lafitte and Barataria \u2014 are still suffering from the devastating effects of the Category 4 storm.\n\nMany, like Trufant Salvant, are bunking with relatives until they can get back into their homes. Others are staying in hotels or have left the state, she said. Some residents have returned to pick up what few belongings may have survived the flood, but she says they aren't finding much to salvage \u2014 the storm surge generated by Ida rose as high as some homes' rooftops.\n\n\"The day that they allowed folks to come back in here, it was like a funeral,\" she said. \"Everybody was just heartbroken, because we had seen devastation before ... but we had never seen anything like this.\"\n\nChurches and charity organizations are working to help, but the destruction is so far-reaching, there don't seem to be enough donations to go around, said Michael Williamson, head of the United Way of Southeast Louisiana, which covers seven parishes hit by Ida.\n\nThe storage room in the United Way's New Orleans headquarters \u2014 typically filled with donated food, water, tarps and cleaning supplies for residents in storm-battered communities \u2014 is nearly bare. Donations have been slow to trickle in compared to previous storms, even smaller ones, and there's not enough to meet the demand, Williamson said.\n\nWhen it comes to tarps and cleaning supplies \u2014 bleach, buckets, mops and rakes \u2014 \"we can't get enough of them,\" he said.\n\nThe United Way is also managing unique cases including that of firefighter Warren Myers, whose 5-year-old special needs daughter, Ameah, requires a specific formula administered through a feeding tube, medicine to control seizures, and diapers, all of which are expensive and have been hard to get since Ida.\n\nStore shelves haven't been as well stocked, and deliveries haven't arrived as regularly as usual, said Crystal Hagger, Myers' fianc\u00e9e, who helps care for Ameah.\n\nAmeah is unable to stand or walk on her own, so the couple carry her everywhere either in their arms or on their backs with a harness-style carrier.\n\nThe family was recently told the United Way found a donor willing to fit Ameah for a pediatric wheelchair.\n\n\"Every little act of kindness goes a long way,\" Hagger said, her voice choked with emotion. \"We are very grateful.\"\n\nThe need is visually evident everywhere.\n\nIn Ironton, Trufant Salvant's house is one of only about eight in her neighborhood not swamped by Ida's floodwaters. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, she was able to raise her home, which now sits 12 feet (3.6 meters) off the ground. She spoke to a visitor while sitting on a stool in a small area beneath the house that had been cleared of mud and debris.\n\nOther homes nearby had shifted or moved off their foundations entirely.

Conviction on each count can bring a sentence of three years in prison plus three years of supervision. Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder entered a not guilty plea on Black's behalf.\n\nThe hearing had been delayed after Black switched lawyers and hired well-known Waukesha criminal defense attorney Anthony Cotton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cotton filed a motion to dismiss the charges, which he says rely on \"misreading of the plain language\" of the law regarding minors with guns.\n\nBlack purchased the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle for Rittenhouse \u2014 who was 17 at the time \u2014 last May at a hardware store near Black's family's property in Rusk County. Rittenhouse has said he used $1,200 in enhanced unemployment pay after his lifeguarding job was ended during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThey used the gun to shoot on private, rural land and it was being kept by Black's stepfather in Kenosha until the night of Aug. 25, when Black and Rittenhouse armed themselves before going downtown. They have said they were asked to protect a car business that had been vandalized and burned during the previous two nights of unrest in the wake of a police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThat night, Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. Rittenhouse was charged with homicides and other counts and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say the shootings were in self-defense. His trial is set for Nov. 1.\n\nWisconsin law makes it a felony for anyone who gives a firearm to someone under 18, and a more serious felony if the minor shoots and kills someone.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the first transfer prohibition \u2014 it's legal to give a minor a gun if it's used for supervised training in gun safety or supervised target practice, and it's legal if a member of the military or National Guard gives a minor a gun in the line of duty.\n\nCotton argues that there's also a requirement to trigger the general ban on minors with guns \u2014 that they must be in violation of rules for young hunters. One law applies to how and when children under 16 may possess firearms while hunting. Another requires young hunters to obtain a hunter safety education certificate.\n\nThe first could not apply because Rittenhouse was 17, Cotton argues, and the second doesn't apply because Rittenhouse wasn't hunting, and therefore wasn't in violation of doing so without a safety education certification.\n\nIn a separate motion, Cotton argues that prosecutors can't charge Black with two counts for the same transfer just because two people were killed. It violates constitutional guarantees of due process and against double jeopardy, the motion states.\n\nHe notes that, under the state's theory, if Rittenhouse had used the gun over a year and killed 12 people, Black could face 12 counts of providing the gun.\n\n\"This absurd conclusion is not supported by a common sense reading of the plain language of the statute, nor by its legislative intent,\" he wrote.\n\nThe motion says prosecutors have the burden of showing the Legislature indeed meant to provide cumulative punishments to the person whose single transfer of a firearm led to multiple deaths.\n\nSchroeder indicated he seemed to agree that the charges \"have a multiplicity problem,\" noting the two counts are identical and don't even identify the two victims."}

Magness will soon depart ERCOT following a 60-day termination notice handed to him by ERCOT's board of directors in March.\n\nIn the weeks since the winter storm, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulatory body that oversees it, have been lambasted for failures in preparing for and responding to the storm.\n\nERCOT underestimated the maximum amount of power that would be demanded by homes, businesses and industry during a severe winter storm in its fall projections, and it overestimated the amount of power generation that would be available to the grid during such a storm.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick had called for Magness and DeAnn Walker, then the head of the PUC, to resign. While Magness was fired, Walker resigned after also coming under harsh criticism from lawmakers. Gov. Greg Abbott called for reforming the governance of ERCOT, and legislation to do so is advancing through the Legislature.\n\nBut after recent leadership shakeups at ERCOT and the PUC, it is state lawmakers who are now increasingly coming under pressure to pass substantial legislation that would protect the state from another power failure the next time inclement weather hits Texas.\n\nAn immediate concern Jones must confront at ERCOT is the prospect of an atypical summer that pushes demand for electricity beyond normal summer peaks. Texas is likely to see a hotter and drier summer than normal this year, according to an April climate outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and 2021 is likely to rank among the 10 warmest years on record globally."}

He chased Mr. Rittenhouse into a parking lot and lunged at him and \u2014 according to Mr. Rittenhouse \u2014 reached for the barrel of his gun, after which Mr. Rittenhouse shot him. After that shooting, a group of protesters turned on Mr. Rittenhouse. Gaige Grosskreutz, who was shot by Mr. Rittenhouse but survived, had been armed with a handgun. He testified that he ran toward Mr. Rittenhouse and thought that he was \"an active shooter.\" While fleeing, Mr. Rittenhouse fell. Anthony Huber attacked him, hitting him with a skateboard, before Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed him. Then Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Grosskreutz after Mr. Grosskreutz pointed his gun at him and advanced. So the self-defense claim was, legally, not a stretch.\n\nMore arcane were the discussions regarding the charge of weapons possession. Adults can openly carry firearms in Wisconsin, but when it comes to minors, the law was confusing, even to the judge. Minors are not allowed to carry guns, but one subsection could be interpreted to exempt long rifles. A local attorney called it an \"extraordinarily poorly worded statute.\" But regardless of the clarity \u2014 or wisdom \u2014 of the law, once it was determined that the rifle that Mr. Rittenhouse carried to the protest had a 16-inch barrel, the judge dismissed the charge.\n\nOne could argue that if Mr. Rittenhouse had not brought a military-style semiautomatic weapon to a volatile situation, no one would be dead. But while this line of inquiry may be consistent with many people's moral intuition, and might even make good policy, it is not the law, and Wisconsin's law was not on trial.\n\nOther features of the Rittenhouse trial were not specific to Wisconsin, and were more representative of the perniciousness of the criminal legal system as a whole. An officer testified that after the shooting, Mr. Rittenhouse approached his car with his weapon strapped to his chest and his hands up in surrender, but officers ordered him to get out of the way and rushed past him to search for the shooter. Apparently, it did not enter their minds that the baby-faced white teen could be the culprit. So Mr. Rittenhouse went home, and ultimately turned himself in."}

From Dr. Jill Biden's head-to-toe violet ensemble by Jonathan Cohen Studio the night before to the brilliant shade of Harris's jewel-toned coat and dress to the rich plum tone of former First Lady Michelle Obama's swaggering jacket, turtleneck and wide-leg trousers cinched with a demonstrative gold buckle belt for the ceremony itself.\n\nFormer Senator, Secretary of State, presidential candidate and First Lady Hillary Clinton wore a vivid purple Ralph Lauren pantsuit and matching scarf under a deep maroon coat, a nod to the Ralph Lauren pantsuit she wore to deliver her concession speech in 2016. Former First Lady Laura Bush's ladified jacket danced on the line between lilac and powder blue, and Senator Amy Klobuchar channeled the hue with her scarf. Even outgoing Vice President Mike Pence's tie, typically ruby red, appeared to be plucked from the burgundy region of Pantone's purple family.\n\nThe color purple is rich with symbolism. It's the color of royalty, and as Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, senior historian of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, points out, \"Our democracy came out of a monarchy and colonial situation. We've never had our own royalty so we tend to project that desire.\"\n\nIt's the color of the Purple Heart, the badge of honor and bravery bestowed by the United States military on veterans wounded or killed in the line of duty. It's the title of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the plight of African American women in the South, a parallel with meaning not lost on the occasion of the swearing in of Harris, the first woman, the first Black and South Asian American to the office of Vice President.\n\nBut today the color purple was also as simple as 1, 2, 3. Paint by numbers: red + blue = purple.

Senate Republicans chose to defend the 'Big Lie' because they feared that anything that might upset Donald Trump could hurt them politically,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said after Friday's vote.\n\nOn Thursday, Schumer pinned the riot directly on Trump saying, \"Rather than accept the results of the election and support the peaceful transfer of power ... former President Trump unabashedly lied, repeatedly, about the results of the election and fomented an armed rebellion, an armed rebellion at the United States Capitol.\"\n\nRepublicans said they feared the commission was aimed at discrediting former President Trump and would be politically damaging for their party leading into the 2022 congressional elections.\n\n\"I've been clear and unflinching in my statements about January the 6th,\" said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"There's no new fact about that day we need the Democrats' extraneous commission to uncover,\" said McConnell who characterised the proposed commission as a partisan effort to tarnish former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe proposed commission would investigate the events of January 6, when hundreds of Trump supporters rampaged through the US Capitol as members of Congress met to formally ratify President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nIt would be tasked with looking into the security and intelligence failures that led to the breach as well as influencing factors, including Trump's role. The panel would be directed to release a final report by December 31.\n\nLegislation establishing the commission passed the Democratic-led House of Representatives with support from 35 rank-and-file Republicans last week. The bill needed 60 votes in the Senate but only gained 54 with 35 Republicans opposed.\n\nThe bill would provide equal standing for Republicans and Democrats on a 10-member commission. But it failed to win support from Republican leaders and Trump loyalists.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump supporter and adherent to the former president's conspiracy claims, warned fellow Republicans last week against supporting the commission.\n\n\"What's going to happen with the January 6th commission is the media is going to use this to smear Trump supporters and President Trump for the next few years,\" she said in remarks to the House."}

Then this plan is for you.\n\nEven with the Ever Given now slowly moving again, the live animals inside the blistering cargo containers, which are quickly running out of feed and water, are now nearing an even more tragic end than that which awaits them in the slaughterhouses at their destination.\n\nEven if the ships were to resume full course today, the water and food would not last until their sea journey is over.\n\nRomania is the source for the 130,000 of the 200,000 live animals now caught in the Suez bottleneck.\n\nSome six of the 11 ships full to the brim with the live animals from the South-Eastern European nation are in a particularly critical situation. They were supposed to reach harbours in the Persian Gulf over four days ago, but still have not left the Canal.\n\nAccording to EU law, ships carrying live animals need to load 25 percent more food than planned for their trip in case of delays, but animal welfare organisations warned that this rarely happens.\n\nMeanwhile, P\u0103un explained to EUobserver that even with the 25 percent buffer, these ships would now run out of animal feed long before they arrive in port.\n\n\"A ship that left Romania on 16 March was scheduled to arrive in Jordan on 23 March, but instead it would now reach port on 1 April at the earliest. That is a nine-day delay. Even if the ship had the required 25 percent additional animal feed, it would only have lasted for 1.5 days\", he said.\n\nThe 'ANSVSA', the Romanian authority in charge of live-animal exports issued a press release two days ago saying that after reaching out to those in charge on board the ships, there is enough food and water to last a few days.\n\nThe press release added that live animal exports have been currently suspended until the situation in the Suez is dealt with.\n\nBut for P\u0103un, those responsible for the shipment would never admit that animals are dying by the thousands on their vessels.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU legislation does not compel an EU member state to report on animal mortality on board these ships and Romania would never release that information voluntarily because authorities know that it would lead to investigations, he added.\n\nRomania is one of Europe's largest live-sheep exporters and has several times been singled out by the European Commission for its bad practices regarding live-animal exports.\n\nLast year, Romania was red-flagged by Brussels for failing to meet live-animal transport conditions after more than 14,000 sheep drowned when a cargo vessel capsized off the Black Sea coast.\n\nA year earlier, the then EU commissioner for food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, urged Romania - to no avail - to stop the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because temperatures inside the cargo vessel exceed 60 degrees Celsius.\n\nInstead, Romanian authorities increased their live-animal exports, despite an investigation that showed animals exported to Gulf countries dying from the high temperatures, being unloaded violently off ships, squeezed into car trunks, and slaughtered by unskilled butchers.\n\nP\u0103un says the only chance now for some of the animals to make it to destination alive is for Egyptian authorities to move quickly and clear the ships trapped in the Suez.\n\n\"I am appalled that legislation did not offer Romania the power to command cargo ships to return back home. Romania should have used diplomatic pressure to resolve the issue,\" he said.\n\n\"According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the EU member state exporting live animals to a third party country is responsible for their wellbeing until reaching destination\", he added."}

Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder.\n\nSince 2019, numerous gangs have ratcheted up pressure with a technique known as \"double extortion.\" Upon entering a system, they steal sensitive data before launching ransomware that encodes the files and makes it impossible for hospitals, universities, and cities to do their daily work. If the loss of computer access is not sufficiently intimidating, they threaten to reveal confidential information, often posting samples as leverage. For instance, when the Washington, DC, police department didn't pay the $4 million ransom demanded by a gang called Babuk last month, Babuk published intelligence briefings, names of criminal suspects and witnesses, and personnel files, from medical information to polygraph test results, of officers and job candidates.\n\nDarkSide, which emerged last August, epitomized this new breed. It chose targets based on a careful financial analysis or information gleaned from corporate emails. For instance, it attacked one of Tantleff's clients during a week when the hackers knew the company would be vulnerable because it was transitioning its files to the cloud and didn't have clean backups.\n\nTo infiltrate target networks, the gang used advanced methods such as \"zero-day exploits\" that immediately take advantage of software vulnerabilities before they can be patched. Once inside, it moved swiftly, looking not only for sensitive data but also for the victim's cyber insurance policy, so it could peg its demands to the amount of coverage. After two to three days of poking around, DarkSide encrypted the files.\n\n\"They have a faster attack window,\" said Christopher Ballod, associate managing director for cyber risk at Kroll, the business investigations firm, who has advised half a dozen DarkSide victims. \"The longer you dwell in the system, the more likely you are to be caught.\"\n\nTypically, DarkSide's demands were \"on the high end of the scale,\" $5 million and up, Ballod said. One scary tactic: if publicly traded companies didn't pay the ransom, DarkSide threatened to share information stolen from them with short-sellers who would profit if the share price dropped upon publication.\n\nDarkSide's site on the dark web identified dozens of victims and described the confidential data it claimed to have filched from them. One was New Orleans law firm Stone Pigman Walther Wittmann. \"A big annoyance is what it was,\" attorney Phil Wittmann said, referring to the DarkSide attack in February. \"We paid them nothing,\" said Michael Walshe Jr., chair of the firm's management committee, declining to comment further.\n\nLast November, DarkSide adopted what is known as a \"ransomware-as-a-service\" model. Under this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder. As this partnership suggests, the ransomware ecosystem is a distorted mirror of corporate culture, with everything from job interviews to procedures for handling disputes. After DarkSide shut down, several people who identified themselves as its affiliates complained on a dispute resolution forum that it had stiffed them. \"The target paid, but I did not receive my share,\" one wrote.\n\nTogether, DarkSide and its affiliates reportedly grossed at least $90 million. Seven of Tantleff's clients, including two companies in the energy industry, paid ransoms ranging from $1.25 million to $6 million, reflecting negotiated discounts from initial demands of $7.5 million to $30 million. His other three clients hit by DarkSide did not pay. In one of those cases, the hackers demanded $50 million. Negotiations grew acrimonious, and the two sides couldn't agree on a price."}

President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama issued long, personal statements about what Powell had meant to them. Former President George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney, expressed their deep personal sadness over the loss. And sitting Secretary of State Anthony Blinken delivered formal remarks recalling how kindly Powell had treated career diplomats and what a mentor Powell had been to many.\n\nThere was nothing from the immediate past president, Donald Trump \u2013 not even a brief, rote statement of condolence. And on Tuesday morning, Trump unloaded on the recently deceased man, dead at 84 from COVID-19 complications, who had crossed party lines to endorse Trump's Democratic opponents in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\"Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO [Republican in Name Only], if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\"\n\nRepublicans aligned with Trump or that wing of the party toed the line, not going so far as to openly insult Powell, but by remaining quiet or putting out brief and impersonal statements of condolence. Only a handful \u2013 such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who angered Trump when the Kentucky Republican said Trump was morally responsible for the Jan. 6 insurrection \u2013 made more effusive remarks .\n\nThis is the new mourning in America, where even the death of a widely admired and barrier-breaking military and diplomatic leader has been reduced to a political talking point. And while the deaths of politicians have been used as partisan platforms before, Trump, experts say, has taken it to a new level.\n\n\"Their silence is a measure of their cowardice\" in failing to praise Powell along with Democrats and Republicans who are not Trump-aligned, says Mac Stipanovich, a veteran Republican political strategist in Florida who now considers himself an independent.\n\n\"They are so afraid of his MAGA myrmidons that they would rather pass up the opportunity to laud a man of the stature of Colin Powell, who richly deserves their praise, particularly in the Republican Party, than run any risk on incurring the disappointment \u2013 not even the wrath \u2013 of Donald Trump,\" Stipanovich adds."}

And if I were among the residents Republicans are targeting, which I'm comfortably not, I'd find it insulting that my elected officials think speaking to the tribal instinct in me is a sufficient enough campaign strategy to secure re-election.\n\nIt's why a predator like Brock Turner, the Stanford University athlete who was convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman behind a dumpster, can garner empathy from the trial judge in his case. \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\" said Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky, adding that he didn't believe Turner would be \"a danger to others\" \u2014 even though he already had been.\n\nIt's why an 18-year-old white male like Rittenhouse can drive from one city to another, be armed for a fight, kill two people, injure another, and be treated like a prodigal son who made an honest mistake in an act of mere self-defense. Over the course of the trial, as the court disallowed words of empathy for the shooting victims and offered space for a tearful killer to plead his case, I've been reminded of how willing our nation is to offer the benefit of the doubt to some while clanking a prison-cell door and throwing away the key for others. Rittenhouse was acquitted on all charges by a 12-person jury on Nov. 19.\n\nAcross the board, active biases like these are easy to spot but hard to tackle. According to Iliana Pujols, policy director with the Connecticut Justice Alliance (CTJA), that's partly because battles over ideological rhetoric are hard to win.\n\n\"It's a really hard fight because we're up against racist ideas,\" she said. \"Not just actions.\"\n\n\"I think this is a perfect time to compare the issues we're seeing in Connecticut to Kenosha,\" Pujols said, \"because it's an empathy issue. The Republican Party doesn't know where these kids are coming from. They can't relate to them.\"\n\nAfter hosting a number of focus groups they call \"vision sessions\" in West Hartford to shine a light on issues impacting urban youth, Pujols said it's clear that those with privilege or in power are making decisions based on a lack of information and predisposed beliefs about youth from places like Waterbury, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport.\n\n\"Everyone's eager to invest in crime prevention now, but that's only because the problem, small as it may be, is coming into their neighborhoods,\" she said.\n\nThat thin border between the inner city and the suburb is often highly policed to ensure there isn't crime creeping into places where it \"doesn't belong.\" Policies to beat city crimes back into the downtown area or low-income neighborhoods are all erected in the spirit of security theater, suggesting that as long as the families with the largest lawns feel safe, that's a job well done."}

And you hold us to be accountable. And I'm glad to say today we're about to announce that we are taking that charge seriously and have heard you. But please continue with your leadership because it's so important. So, thank you.\n\nAnd good morning, everyone. It is great to be in the house of labor. (Applause.) Good morning. (Laughs.) Good morning. And it's so good to be here at the AFL-CIO.\n\nYou know, the last time I was in this building was in August, and it was early in the morning. My husband, Doug, and I came here to pay our respects and say goodbye to the late, great Rich Trumka. And as we all know, he was a man who lived and breathed solidarity.\n\nAnd I remember that morning because we wanted to just come in and be lowkey. And \u2014 and so we walked in the door and there was Liz Shuler. And she greeted me with a big ole warm hug, and we talked that day about Rich's legacy, about the tremendous mark he made and left on our nation.\n\nAnd, Liz, we also talked about the future because that's what I believe Rich would have wanted. And we talked in a way that was not only the focus on what we have achieved, but we talked about what we still have yet to do. And Liz knows what we must do.\n\nWe have worked together for some time now, and I will tell you Liz knows we must protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. She knows we must strengthen those rights. She knows we cannot let up or ever accommodate any amount of progress. We must stay vigilant. And she knows that the Biden-Harris administration will always stand in solidarity with the American labor movement. (Applause.)\n\nSo you all know, and the President and I have been clear: We are determined and we are proud say, perhaps sometimes with a bit of bravado, that we will be the most pro-labor union administration in America's history \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and we are proud of that. And we are proud of that.\n\nAnd it's for good reason. Because we're clear: When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union jobs are safer, our communities are safer. And when union members go to work, they go to work for all of us. They teach our students and care for our patients. They lay broadband lines and manufacture electric vehicles. And union members replace lead pipes \u2013- (applause) \u2014 which is what brings me here today.\n\nOver the years, I have traveled around the country and I have met many parents to talk about this very issue \u2013- so many parents \u2013- parents who are worried that every time they turned on the faucet to get their child a glass of water, that they may be filling that glass with poison; parents who worry, as they make breakfast in the morning or in the evening help their children to brush their teeth, that they are exposing their children to something that could harm them.\n\nAnd the science is clear about what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body. For adults, it can cause an increase in blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it can severely harm mental and physical development. It can stunt growth, slow down learning, and cause irreparable damage to the brain.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that there is no reason in the 21st century for why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people back in the 18th century. There is no good reason."}

Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat\u2014and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nIn the beginning, Secretary of State Colin Powell was expected to be the star of the George W. Bush administration. Judging from polls, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and victorious Gulf War strategist was more popular than Bush, and he might have been president himself. Powell could silence a room just by clearing his throat\u2014and he would present the judicious view in every cabinet meeting.\n\nPowell, who died Monday at age 84, was heir to a treasured tradition of pragmatic internationalism harking back to his hero George C. Marshall, another ex-general who became America's top diplomat; Henry Stimson (secretary of state under Herbert Hoover and secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt); and Dean Acheson, Harry Truman's secretary of state. Powell added his own strategic embellishment to this tradition. A cornerstone of what came to be known as the Powell Doctrine was that the use of U.S. military force should be astringent in the extreme. It should be mobilized only with overwhelming numbers, in situations where victory was near-certain, and where the exit strategy was clear. Powell also believed that the support of U.S. allies was critical.\n\nAs we know, this did not become the view\u2014or the policy\u2014of the Bush administration. Bush went in virtually the opposite direction, unilaterally invading Iraq after 9/11 on concocted evidence (Powell's worst moment in public life was presenting this evidence to the United Nations in 2003) with insufficient planning and no exit strategy in sight. The Powell Doctrine was also absent from 20 years of muddling through in Afghanistan, where there was no sense of what victory would look like.\n\nYet it appears that one of Powell's most enduring legacies will be a renewed embrace of his guiding philosophy. President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan came because, he complained, the Pentagon could give him no clear strategy for success. In attempting to regain their credibility with their civilian overlords, U.S. military officials will no doubt fall back on Powellian restraint, as a number of commentators have suggested in recent months.\n\n\"We could have avoided the expenditure of over $2 trillion dollars, the loss of the lives of more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen, as well as the tragic and humiliating disaster that is unfolding in Afghanistan if we had applied the Powell Doctrine twenty years ago,\" Richard J. Pierce Jr., a George Washington University scholar, wrote in the Hill in August.\n\nAccording to Seth Jones, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, most of the Powell Doctrine \"appears to be relevant today, including the list of questions that any U.S. policymaker needs to ask before deciding on military action.\" Still, Jones said a revived Powell Doctrine will not be sufficient by itself. \"The rules tell us whether or not to use force, not what happens over the course of a conflict,\" he said."}

This was a coup attempt in the United States.\"\n\nGrygiel said the platform's decision to remove the video \u2014 and Twitter's suspension \u2014 are too little, too late.\n\n\"They're creeping along towards firmer action,\" Grygiel said, calling Trump \"Exhibit A\" for the need for greater regulation of social media. \"Social media is complicit in this because he has repeatedly used social media to incite violence. It's a culmination of years of propaganda and abuse of media by the president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump posted the video more than two hours after protesters entered the Capitol, interrupting lawmakers meeting in a joint session to confirm the electoral college results and president-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nGuy Rosen, Facebook's vice-president of integrity, said on Twitter Wednesday that the video was removed because it \"contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.\""}

We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully,\" said one of the Taliban intelligence officials.\n\nIslamic State in Khorasan, the name taken from the ancient name for the region that includes modern Afghanistan, first emerged in late 2014 but has declined from its peak around 2018 following a series of heavy losses inflicted by both the Taliban and U.S. forces.\n\nTaliban security forces in Nangarhar said they had killed three members of the movement on Wednesday night and the intelligence officials said the movement still retains the ability to cause trouble through small-scale attacks.\n\n\"Their main structure is broken and they are now divided in small groups to carry out attacks,\" one of them said.\n\nFUNDING DRIED UP\n\nThe Taliban have said repeatedly that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries. But some Western analysts believe the return of the Islamist group to power has invigorated groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, which had made Afghanistan their base when the Taliban last ruled the country.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, the return of Taliban is a huge victory for the Islamists,\" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. \"They have celebrated the return of the Taliban, so I think that Afghanistan is the new theatre.\"\n\nISIS-K is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP, but much of the way it operates remains little understood.\n\nIt has fought the Taliban over smuggling routes and other economic interests but it also supports a global Caliphate under Islamic law, in contrast with the Taliban which insists it has no interest in anywhere outside Afghanistan.\n\nMost analysts, as well as the United Nations peg ISIS-K's strength at under 2,000 fighters, compared to as many as 100,000 at the Taliban's disposal. The ranks of ISIS-K were swollen with prisoners released when Afghanistan's jails were opened by the Taliban as they swept through the country.\n\nAccording to a June report by the UN security council, ISIS-K's financial and logistic ties to its parent organisation in Syria have weakened, though it does retain some channels of communication.\n\n\"Funding support to the Khorasan branch from the core is believed to have effectively dried up,\" the report said."}

They were out to lunch at Merry Piglets, a Tex-Mex restaurant, between 1 and 2 p.m. on Aug. 27, when they said an agitated Laundrie began arguing with a waitress. Four and a half hours later, a travel-blogging couple passed Petito's van at a campsite north of town.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Wednesday, the restaurant confirmed the two were there.\n\n\"Yes, we can confirm Gabby and Brian were in Merry Piglets...We have already notified the FBI and they are aware.

Angelo and England said bodycam video of the police response matched the mannerisms and body language of Petito and Laundrie they witnessed firsthand.

Roberts was the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the chief domestic accomplishment of the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the Supreme Court, swore in Vice President Harris, the first woman to hold the job. Sotomayor did the same for then-Vice President Biden in 2013.\n\nAlso in attendance was Justice Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama, and all three of Trump's selections for the court: Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThat presented more opportunities for awkwardness: They were seated behind Harris, who vigorously opposed all three. In particular, she conducted a heated grilling of Kavanaugh that thrilled liberals and deeply angered conservatives.\n\nAs a team, former senators Biden and Harris voted against six of the nine justices on the current court.\n\nThat might explain some of the no-shows.\n\nThomas, 72, and Alito, 70, are a different story.\n\nBiden attempted to filibuster Alito's nomination and said President George W. Bush's choice was too conservative to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who at the time was the Supreme Court's pivotal justice.\n\nBiden has even more history with Thomas, who was confirmed when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas's nomination was disrupted by allegations of sexual harassment leveled by Anita Hill, who previously had worked in government jobs with Thomas."}

As The Washington Post reported Thursday, Cuomo participated in official strategy sessions with political advisers guiding his brother, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), on how to respond to sexual-harassment allegations.\n\nZucker had tolerated other missteps by his increasingly controversial prime-time star. But this time, he informed Cuomo that he had crossed a line. And he urged him to go on TV to explain himself.\n\nIn some ways, it was a classic move on the part of Zucker, a veteran of NBC's entertainment division during the rise of reality TV, to capitalize on some behind-the-scenes drama by turning it into programming. (His conversation with Cuomo was described by people familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations at CNN.) Yet it also tracked with CNN's by now well-established policy of how to deal with the roiling, inherent conflict of the Cuomo brother dynamic \u2014 essentially by embracing it.\n\nAnd even as many CNN employees griped privately about Cuomo's decision to insert himself into his brother's political operation, by early this week it seemed likely that he would survive this controversy, too, in large part because of Zucker's unwavering support.\n\nAt a town hall meeting for staff members Tuesday, Zucker acknowledged the concerns about Cuomo's seemingly untouchable status at CNN while defending his decision not to punish him by taking him off the air.\n\n\"There is no one else in Chris's shoes,\" Zucker told the staff, referring to the newsman's unique identity as the brother of a major newsmaker. \"There are not special rules for Chris, and it does not excuse his mistake. It was more powerful and more honest to publicly say he screwed up and for him to publicly acknowledge his mistake.\"\n\nAs the anchor of one of the nighttime hours that cable news has increasingly ceded to opinion, Cuomo also has more latitude to venture into personal expression than traditional news-deliverers \u2014 part of CNN's justification for his jovial, soft-focus segments interviewing the governor during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nYet the revelation that Cuomo had taken on the role of political adviser brings CNN ever more uncomfortably into the kind of partisanship adopted by conservative rival Fox News Channel, whose prime-time hosts regularly counseled Donald Trump during his presidency.\n\n\"It baffles many of us inside why the network seems to exempt Chris from so many of the good limitations that journalists should adhere to,\" said one of CNN's on-air journalists, speaking on the condition of anonymity to criticize colleagues."}

That was my brother!\"\n\nThe raw and emotional scene was described by Mark Schmitz, father of 20-year-old Jared Schmitz, in The Washington Post. Mr Schmitz said he grew agitated as Mr Biden appeared to check his watch and responded bluntly when asked to remember the men and women killed in Kabul.\n\n\"I said, 'Don't you ever forget that name. Don't you ever forget that face.

I was more focused on my own son than what happened with him and his son,\" Mr Schmitz said.\n\n\"I'm not trying to insult the president, but it just didn't seem that appropriate to spend that much time on his own son.\"\n\nBeau Biden, a military veteran who was deployed to Iraq, died of brain cancer in 2015, and the president has used his death in an attempt to connect with families that have suffered similar grief.\n\nJiennah McCollum, the pregnant wife of Marine Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, was left disappointed by Mr Biden's conversation, her sister Roice McCollum told Post of what she described as a \"scripted and shallow\" exchange.\n\n\"You cannot kneel on our flag and pretend you care about our troops. You can't f*** up as bad as he did and say you're sorry. This did not need to happen, and every life is on his hands,\" Ms McCollum said.\n\n\"The thousands of Afghans who will suffer and be tortured is a direct result of his incompetence.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the president when asked about the meeting.\n\n\"While his son did not lose his life directly in combat as they did \u2013 or directly at the hands of a terrorist, as these families did that they're mourning \u2013 he knows, as I just said, firsthand that there's nothing you can say, nothing you can convey, to ease the pain and to ease what all of these families are going through,\" Ms Psaki told reporters.\n\n\"It is certainly the right of any individual who met with the president yesterday to speak publicly about their experience,\" she added."}

During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).\n\nThe two agencies have determined the following:\n\nUse of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.\n\nThe FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine's known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\nAt this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.\n\nHealth care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers, which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.\n\nCDC's independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.\n\n\"Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work\u2014identifying even these small number of cases. We've lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC's review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,\" said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.\n\n\"Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. \"Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events \u2013 out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered \u2013 and we paused to examine them more carefully.

Rather, under the Former Presidents Act, he would lose his pension only if the Senate voted to convict him and remove him from office.\n\nLots of average citizens use the word \"impeachment\" to refer to impeachment and removal, so we're not bashing Costiloe for this common error, but the statement is incorrect.\n\nPresidents who have not been impeached and removed are entitled to a lifetime pension equivalent to the annual salary of a head of an executive department. For Trump, like predecessor President Barack Obama, that would indeed amount to more than $200,000 per year.\n\nRunning in 2024\n\nNeither a second House impeachment nor even a Senate vote to convict Trump and remove him from office would prevent him from running again, in 2024 or beyond.\n\nRather, after two-thirds of senators present voted to remove Trump, a simple majority of senators present would have to approve an additional vote to bar him from the presidency in the future.\n\nThe Senate could not skip the conviction-and-removal vote that requires two-thirds of senators and go straight to the simple-majority vote for future disqualification, Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer who teaches at Tulane Law School, told CNN."}

The golf superstar had to be extricated, and his agent said he was undergoing leg surgery.\n\nWoods was alone in the SUV when it crashed shortly before 7:15 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. No other cars were involved.\n\nThe cause of the wreck wasn't clear. The two-lane road curves through upscale suburbs and the northbound side that Woods was driving on descends steeply enough that signs warn trucks to use lower gears. The speed limit is 45 mph.\n\nA KABC-TV helicopter showed the car on its side, with its front end heavily damaged just off the side of a road near a hillside, with its airbags deployed. The 45-year-old Woods was taken to the hospital by ambulance, authorities said.\n\n\"Tiger Woods was in a single-car accident this morning in California where he suffered multiple leg injuries,\" said his manager, Mark Steinberg. \"He is currently in surgery and we thank you for your privacy and support.\"\n\nThe crash happened on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes, two upscale communities about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThere was a second crash when a vehicle that had apparently stopped to help Woods got hit, said Christopher Thomas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. That wreck was very minor, and no one was hurt.\n\nWoods was in Los Angeles over the weekend as the tournament host of the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, where he presented the trophy on Sunday. He was to spend Monday and Tuesday filming with Discovery-owned GOLFTV, with whom he has an endorsement. A tweet Monday showed Woods in a cart smiling with comedian David Spade.\n\nAccording to Golf Digest, also owned by Discovery, the TV shoot was on-course lessons for celebrities, such as Spade and Dwyane Wade, at Rolling Hills Country Club.\n\nWoods, a 15-time major champion who shares with Sam Snead the PGA Tour record of 82 career victories, has been recovering from Dec. 23 surgery on his lower back. It was his fifth back surgery and first since his lower spine was fused in April 2017, allowing him to stage a remarkable comeback that culminated with his fifth Masters title in 2019.\n\nHe has carried the sport since his record-setting Masters victory in 1997 when he was 21, winning at the most prolific rate in modern PGA Tour history. He is singularly responsible for TV ratings spiking, which has led to enormous increases in prize money during his career. Even at 45, he remains the biggest draw in the sport.\n\nThe SUV he was driving Tuesday had tournament logos on the side door, indicating it was a courtesy car for players at the Genesis Invitational. Tournament director Mike Antolini did not immediately respond to a text message, though it is not unusual for players to keep courtesy cars a few days after the event.\n\nWoods feared he would never play again until the 2017 fusion surgery. He returned to win the Tour Championship to close out the 2018 season and won the Masters in April 2019 for the fifth time.\n\nHe last played Dec. 20 in the PNC Championship in Orlando, Florida, an unofficial event where players are paired with parents or children. He played with his son, Charlie, who is now 12. Woods also has a 13-year-old daughter."}

The federal law, which is part of the Communications Decency Act, provides legal immunity to websites that moderate user-generated content.\n\n\"We're reviewing that, and certainly they should be held accountable,\" Bedingfield told MSNBC when asked about Section 230 and whether social media companies like Facebook should be liable and open to lawsuits for publishing false information that causes Americans harm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Bedingfield said, also believes it is \"the responsibility of the people creating the content.\"\n\n\"It is a big and complicated ecosystem, and everybody bears responsibility to ensure that we are not providing people with bad information about a vaccine that will save their lives,\" she said.\n\nBoth Biden and then-President Donald Trump have advocated for revoking Section 230, but for different reasons.\n\nBiden has long railed against the law for its protection of social media companies from misinformation, whereas Trump has claimed that it leads to the censorship and suppression of conservative voices. Supporters of the provision, meanwhile, argue that the law protects free speech. Trump's attempts to use the executive branch to change how Section 230 is applied to tech companies was called unconstitutional by legal experts, lawmakers and officials at the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe Biden administration now confronts many of the same legal questions. But only Congress can amend the law itself, and while US lawmakers may be united in their hostility to Big Tech, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill remain split on how Section 230 should be updated.\n\nBiden kept the pressure on Facebook on Monday, saying he not satisfied with what the platform is doing to stop the spread of misinformation, but backing off his accusation from last week that it was directly responsible for \"killing people.\" And senior officials are in touch with Facebook behind the scenes as tensions with the platform have escalated.\n\n\"Facebook isn't killing people \u2013 these 12 people are out there giving misinformation. Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information,\" Biden said, appearing to cite data from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). A report published by the organization in March indicated that about a dozen people were super-spreaders of anti-vaccine misinformation.\n\nThe President continued, \"My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally, that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation, the outrageous misinformation about the vaccine. That's what I meant.\""}

But Ida also encountered natural barriers like wetlands that act as a \"speed bump\" and blunt the impact of storms.\n\nAlthough natural defenses have their limits \u2014 especially with major events like Ida \u2014 experts say they can play an important part in protecting communities and the environment when storms strike.\n\n\"There is always a benefit by having these wetlands between you and the storm,\" said Gerald Galloway, a recently retired University of Maryland engineering professor who previously worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nSince the devastation of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, a key part of Louisiana's efforts to bulk up its storm defenses has been restoring the wetlands and barrier islands the state has been losing for decades along its coast.\n\nHOW DOES NATURAL TERRAIN PROTECT AGAINST STORMS?\n\nWetlands and other natural terrain can act as buffers for wind and water, giving storm surges more to overcome before they reach people and buildings.\n\n\"They help with storm protection because they are dissipating energy,\" said Hugh J. Roberts, chief operating officer at the Water Institute of the Gulf, an environmental research group.\n\nRoberts compared it to a cyclist riding over rocky debris. Sparse wetlands are like riding over a few pebbles, he said \u2014 hardly noticeable. But robust wetlands with elevated terrains are like trying to ride over a long, bumpier stretch of gravel.\n\nThe Water Institute has received funding from the Walton Family Foundation, which also supports The Associated Press' coverage of water and environmental policy.\n\nWHAT ABOUT BIG STORMS LIKE IDA?\n\nWetlands are generally more effective at lessening the impact of small to moderate surges of ocean water, said Ed Link, a researcher at the University of Maryland who previously directed an analysis of New Orleans' storm protections after Katrina.\n\nWith bigger storms like Ida, the effect may be more muted. Once wetlands are full of water, they lose their ability to slow down waves and the storm can travel over them, Link said."}

Use this calculator\n\nCNN \u2014 A third round of stimulus payments is expected to be on the way later this month.\n\nThe payments are included in a sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid relief package and are worth up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. So a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600. Unlike prior rounds, families will now receive the additional money for adult dependents over the age of 17.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Individuals who earn at least $80,000 a year of adjusted gross income, heads of households who earn at least $120,000 and married couples who earn at least $160,000 will be completely cut off from the third round of stimulus payments \u2013 regardless of how many children they have.\n\nHere's what else you need to know:\n\nOn what year are the income limits based?\n\nThe income thresholds will be based on a taxpayer's most recent return. If they've already filed a 2020 return by the time the payment is sent, the IRS will base eligibility on their 2020 adjusted gross income. If not, it will be based on the 2019 return or the information submitted through an online portal set up last year for people who don't usually file tax returns.\n\nWhen can you expect the money?\n\nPeople could start seeing the payments hit their bank accounts within days of President Joe Biden signing the bill.\n\nFor the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the IRS started sending out the second round of payments three days after then-President Donald Trump signed that legislation in late December. But it's possible that tax filing season, which is underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nYou got the last stimulus check. Will you get this one?\n\nThe payments do not all go out at once. Those whose bank information is on file with the IRS would likely get the money first, because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. Others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nNot necessarily. While the same people who received the full amounts in the previous two rounds of stimulus payments will likely get the full amount this time, the checks will phase out faster now \u2013 cutting off people at a lower income level.\n\nThe first round, which was worth up to $1,200, excluded individuals who earned at least $99,000, head of household filers with one child who earned more than $136,500 and married couples without children earning more than $198,000 \u2013 but families earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 160 million payments were delivered, with 94% of families receiving the money.\n\nThe second round, which was worth up to $600, also phased out a little faster because the full amount was smaller. It phased out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children. Again, those earning a little more were still eligible if they had children. About 158 million payments went out, with 92% of families receiving them.\n\nThe payments have been based on a taxpayer's most recent tax return. So those who have filed new returns since last March could fall into or out of eligibility if their incomes changed.\n\nWho else isn't eligible?\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But their spouses and children are eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers. They were excluded from the first round.\n\nWill you owe back some money to the IRS if you earned more in 2020?\n\nNo. If your 2019 income was less than your pay in 2020 you will not owe back any money.\n\nBut if your income fell in 2020, filing your tax return now \u2013 before the payments go out \u2013 may mean you'll get a bigger check."}

One possible consequence is that al Qaeda and ISIS will be given safe haven to plan and carry out attacks, perhaps while using U.S. military gear.\n\nAnd despite the Taliban's brutality and dishonesty, two Taliban spokesmen have Twitter accounts, including Zabihullah Mujahid, who boasts nearly 320,000 followers. Mujahid has posted dozens of videos that have been viewed millions of times. Quite a platform for the Taliban to have, and it doesn't cost them a dime.\n\nIt's odd and patently disturbing that pro-al Qaeda groups and the Taliban have social media accounts to spew propaganda and recruit across the world. Because at last check, Twitter often and quickly bans accounts it deems to be spreading misinformation or sees as public threats.\n\nYet here we are.

Twitter's top priority is keeping people safe, and we remain vigilant.\"\n\n\"We will continue to proactively enforce our rules and review content that may violate Twitter Rules,\" the spokesperson added, \"specifically policies against the glorification of violence, platform manipulation and spam.\"\n\nEnter the Washington Post on Wednesday to defend Twitter. The Post published what amounted to a defense of the Taliban's \"strikingly sophisticated\" social media prowess and juxtaposed it with Donald Trump's.\n\n\"For a group that espouses ancient moral codes, the Afghan Taliban has used strikingly sophisticated social media tactics to build political momentum and, now that they're in power, to make a public case that they're ready to lead a modern nation state after nearly 20 years of war,\" two of the Post's technology reporters wrote.\n\n\"The answer, analysts said, may simply be that Trump's posts for years challenged platform rules against hate speech and inciting violence,\" the piece adds. \"Today's Taliban, by and large, does not.\"\n\nAh, okay \u2014 so Twitter should totally keep an organization on its platform to spread propaganda and recruit because ...why again? The Taliban's actions, not its words, need to be taken into account here, because its words and actions contradict each another.\n\nJust this week, the Taliban reportedly killed a woman in Kabul for the crime of not wearing a burqa. Women and children are being whipped and beaten in the streets. Young girls are reportedly being forced to marry Taliban fighters. Anyone rumored to have worked with the U.S. is being executed. Proof? Due process? You're kidding, right?\n\nGiven those facts, how does Twitter justify allowing the Taliban to remain on its platform, which will only make it more powerful?\n\nPerhaps predictably, the Washington Post's defense got torched on social media.\n\nThe Taliban remains on Twitter.
