Her death on the \"Rust\" film set is another reminder of what every injured worker knows: that \"accidental\" workplace deaths and injuries are the result of overwork, cost cutting and deliberate neglect of basic safety by management. In this case management includes the star and producer of \"Rust,\" Alec Baldwin, who fired the fatal shot that also injured director Joel Souza. The role of assistant director David Halls who handed Baldwin the loaded prop gun is under investigation as well.\n\nHutchins' death occurred during the struggle of film production workers for sufficient hours between shifts and for needed meal breaks, during recent months of 60-hour shifts on film sets. Workers on \"Rust\" were promised housing in Santa Fe, but the movie company broke that promise, and most of them were forced to drive 50 miles each way from Albuquerque to work 12-hour days.\n\nBaldwin had called in a nonunion crew to replace the IATSE members at the time of the shooting. Hutchins, a member of International Cinematographers Guild Local 600, had supported the workers. Local 480 and Local 600 held a candlelight vigil for her Oct. 24, attended by over 400 union members at the Albuquerque Civic Plaza.\n\nOne of the IATSE members at the vigil told Workers World in regards to overall exhaustion and the lack of lunch breaks: \"They give us meal penalties. If we don't break after six hours, they give us more money the longer we don't break. It's good money, but we are exhausted. We don't want the extra money anymore.\"\n\nWhat happened in Santa Fe is not an isolated incident. \"Safety on Set\" is the primary issue for the 60,000 IATSE members across the country who voted in favor of a strike earlier in October. A strike was averted when the union reached a tentative agreement with movie and television industry executives, but the contract could be rejected if members don't think it goes far enough in addressing their issues. That could lead to a strike.\n\nAs the contract vote gets underway, the tragedy in Santa Fe reminds workers of what is at stake. A countrywide IATSE strike would not be an isolated skirmish but would be another front in the current resurgence of labor militancy.\n\nWill Striketober become Strikevember?\n\nAs the month referred to as \"Striketober\" comes to a close, there are more signs of worker resistance. According to Cornell University's Labor Action Tracker, there are at least 40 U.S. strikes in progress currently \u2014 26 of which began this month. New strikes may be on the way.\n\nAfter three years of trying to negotiate a decent contract, 350 Piedmont airlines flight attendants voted Oct. 21 to authorize a strike. After the vote dozens in Philadelphia picketed the company, a subsidiary of American Airlines. The slight wage increase management offered would be more than offset by an increase in the workers' share of health care costs."}

This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n\nCounterterrorism strategy for arrests\n\nAt least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations, to find even a minimal charge and try to take a person of concern off the streets. That helps ease the possible threat amid concern about possible attacks on the inauguration, officials believe.\n\nOn January 4, for example, local police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, in Washington, DC.\n\nTarrio was taken into custody for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after an earlier \"Stop the Steal\" rally. The Miami resident was charged with destruction of property related to the banner, however, federal authorities say they found Tarrio in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting them to add a charge of Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal authorities in New York City arrested Eduard Florea, 40, on at least one weapons charge after law enforcement, including the FBI and NYPD, responded to a Queens home in response to online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that the man claims to be a Proud Boy and was arrested with live ammunition in the home.\n\nAlready, the public efforts by prosecutors and the FBI to encourage people who participated In the riot to turn themselves in is yielding fruit. Some attorneys have reached out to arrange for safe surrender of their clients in order to gain a measure of leniency and lessen the chance of a police raid on their homes, two officials said.\n\nFor instance, a counterterrorism prosecutor even appeared in court for an early hearing for one of the defendants on Tuesday, signaling how integrated the Justice Department's effort already is between the typical criminal prosecutors who handle initial criminal hearings and with the units focused on more complex crimes.\n\n\"With this strike force that was established to focus strictly on sedition charges, we're looking at in treating this just like a significant international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation,\" DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday.\n\n\"We're looking at everything: money, travel records. Looking at disposition, movement, communication records. So no resource related to the FBI, or the US Attorney's Office will be unchecked in terms of trying to determine exactly if there was a command and control how it operated and how they executed these, these activities.\""}

Graham began his NFL coaching career in New England from 2009-15, a stretch in which Brady and the Patriots won the AFC East title all seven seasons, the conference championship twice and Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nGiven that experience, Graham was asked if it would have been more advantageous for the Giants had Brady thrown five touchdowns in a victory last week and not entered this game looking to make amends for an unsatisfactory performance in an unexpected defeat. Graham's response was, in essence: no way.\n\n\"I was around him for seven years, every week is different for him,\" Graham said. \"I don't know anybody that's more competitive, more serious about the game and, on top of that, he's a great person. I mean, if they won by 20 touchdowns or if they lost, it doesn't matter. If he's playing the New York Giants on Monday night, that's where his focus is and it's laser focus. If you had a chance to be around him, it's laser focus, truly. To be around one of the best to ever play the game and just see that focus \u2013 I mean, I remember practicing against him \u2013 it just makes you have to raise your level as a coach because he'll take advantage. If you don't have it fixed, he's going to take advantage of it. I don't think that will play into it at all really, not with him at all, I don't think so.\"\n\nWhen these teams met last season on a Monday night in MetLife Stadium, the Buccaneers had won two in a row and five of their previous six games. The Giants jumped out to a 14-6 halftime lead. But Brady threw second-half touchdowns to Ron Gronkowski and Mike Evans and when the Giants came up short on a late two-point conversion attempt, Tampa Bay won, 25-23.\n\n\"Tom's going to figure it out,\" Graham said. \"I mean, you look back at the tape to try to have a reference point because, again, most of their offense is the same offense. They're the only team in the league to come back with all 22 starters. There are some different pieces, so you look back to have a reference point there, but each game is so different and Tom, B.A. (coach Bruce Arians), and (offensive coordinator Byron) Leftwich, they're all treating it as it's a different game."}

Black testified that video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse and reaching for the teenager's gun, Huber attacking Rittenhouse with a skateboard and trying to wrestle away his gun, and Grosskreutz running at him with a pistol in his hand.\n\n\"A citizen in that position, given those indicators, would it be reasonable for them to believe they were about to be assaulted?\" Black said. \"I would argue yes.\"\n\nRittenhouse was 17 years old when he made the short trip from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha on the night of Aug. 25, 2020, in response to a call from a Kenosha militia to help protect businesses from protesters. The city was in the throes of several nights of chaotic demonstrations sparked by a white police officer's decision to shoot Jacob Blake, a Black man, during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nShortly before midnight, Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle in the parking lot of a used car dealership, killing him. Moments later, he shot Huber in the street, killing him as well. Seconds after shooting Huber he shot Grosskreutz, wounding him in the arm.\n\nProsecutors have charged Rittenhouse with multiple counts, including homicide, attempted homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Rittenhouse's attorneys say he fired in self-defense. His trial is slated to begin Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse's lead attorney, Mark Richards, is trying to persuade Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder to let Black testify at the trial. Schroeder allowed Black to speak at the hearing via Zoom in hopes that would help him make a decision.\n\nBlack testified that he studied bystander video of the three shootings extensively. He noted that Rosenbaum was chasing Rittenhouse and threw a plastic bag at him before reaching for Rittenhouse's rifle.\n\n\"Now the firearm is a potential weapon for both parties,\" Black said. \"Now we have a potential wrestling match.\"\n\nBystander video showed that after Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum, he ran down the street. At one point he stumbled and a man came out of the crowd and kicked him in the face, Black said. Rittenhouse fired at that man but missed."}

And in a particularly noteworthy moment, Biden cited a \"rise of political extremism, white supremacy, [and] domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\"\n\nBiden is not the first US president to discuss racism in his inaugural address. In Barack Obama's first speech as president, he observed that \"a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\" President George W. Bush in 2005 and president Bill Clinton in 1997 both acknowledged the persistence of racism in the US.\n\nBut Biden is the first to specifically acknowledge the existence of white supremacy. That's an important sign of the way that the popular understanding of racism in the US has evolved in recent years, and of how Biden may approach racial inequality in office.\n\nAs the New York Times explained last fall, for the past few decades, the American mainstream media was more likely to reserve the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan\u2014hate groups that claimed their own bigotry and had an explicit agenda to kill and/or oppress people of color and Jewish people.\n\nBut over the past 10 years, influential people like writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and activist-athlete Colin Kaepernick have helped to not only popularize the term, but to broaden its application to refer not only to those who explicitly embrace white supremacy. In the current parlance\u2014and particularly in the wake of the widespread discussions about racism that began last summer\u2014white supremacy is understood as a force enacted through systems and institutions that benefits white people while oppressing non-white people, evident in everything from the US legal system to the way corporations hire.\n\nWhite supremacy is particularly useful as a term that encapsulates the ways racism can be reinforced independently of individual prejudice. \"People have this misconception that [white supremacy] has something to do with hate or racial animus, and it doesn't,\" journalist Michael Harriott explained in an interview last summer. The fact that majority-white schools have more funding than majority-Black schools, or that Black people are disproportionately more likely to be shot and killed by police, are illustrations of white supremacy in action."}

The lawyers recommended Chris Cuomo's termination and CNN chief Jeff Zucker informed the anchor of the decision on Saturday.\n\n\"It goes without saying that these decisions are not easy, and there are a lot of complex factors involved,\" Zucker said in an email to CNN staff on Saturday.\n\nThe network said that \"while in the process of that review, additional information has come to light.\" CNN would not discuss that information, or characterize whether it had anything to do with his brother.\n\nCuomo issued a statement on Twitter calling the decision disappointing.\n\n\"This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did,\" he said.\n\nEven with the firing, CNN said it will continue to investigate Cuomo's conduct \"as appropriate.\"\n\nA year ago the two sons of the late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo were flying high: Andrew as a three-term governor praised initially in many circles for his handling of the pandemic, Chris as the top-rated personality on CNN. Now they're both out of work.\n\nAs women came forward accusing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment, his brother, despite being a CNN anchor, pressed sources for information on the accusers and reported back to the governor's staff on what he was learning.\n\nHe was active in helping craft their response to the charges, according to emails and a transcript of his testimony to investigators working for state Attorney General Letitia James.

He was 43. But he knew his golf history as well as he knew the famed layout at Augusta National, where he had won four times, and set the record straight.\n\n\"One of the greatest comebacks in all of sports is the gentleman who won here, Mr. Hogan,\" Woods said of Ben Hogan, a two-time Masters winner who is universally revered and always referred to as \"Mr. Hogan.\" Never \"Ben.\"\n\nWoods continued, \"I mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships.

One of the greatest comebacks there is and it happens to be in our sport.\"\n\nWoods won the tournament.\n\nBen Hogan has been dead for nearly a quarter-century, but his name has been trending this week in the wake of Woods' horrible car accident in California. Woods wasn't even out of surgery before speculation arose about another Tiger comeback, this time maybe even bigger than Hogan's. Woods is being held to a very high standard \u2014 that of the man who returned from a near-death experience to win seven majors in the next four years.\n\nThe two are inextricably linked both by history and success. Hogan was the dominant player of his era, which spanned from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. Likewise, Woods ruled the golf world for more than a decade. Woods won more majors, but Hogan only competed in the British Open once (he won) and stopped participating in the PGA after winning it for a second time in 1948.

While many people with COVID-19 get mild symptoms, others can become seriously ill. Several vaccines have been developed to protect against COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. Two of these are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Both of these vaccines require two doses. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has also been authorized for emergency use. However, this vaccine only requires one dose. Why do some vaccines require two doses? How long do you need to wait between doses? Do you have any immunity after the first dose? This article will help explain why you need two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and will provide answers to many other questions, too.\n\nHow do these vaccines work? The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both use mRNA technology. The cells in your body naturally use mRNA all the time to create many different types of proteins that you need to stay healthy. The mRNA in the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines provide the cells of your body with instructions on how to make the spike protein that's specific to the new coronavirus. This spike protein is found on the surface of the virus. It uses this spike protein to attach to and enter a host cell in your body. When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, your immune system processes information on the spike protein and generates an immune response to it. This includes the production of antibodies. Vaccines hinge on a very important aspect of your immune system, which is the fact that it has memory. After your vaccination, your immune system continues to store information on the spike protein. If you're exposed to the new coronavirus, your immune system will then use this stored information to respond and protect you from the virus. This can help prevent you from becoming sick with COVID-19. The entire immunity process typically takes around 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. That's why you can still contract the new coronavirus and become ill if you're exposed to it shortly after getting your vaccine."}

Here's what to know\n\nThe offers mentioned below are no longer available.\n\nAt least 90 million stimulus checks went out last week as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, but there are still many Americans waiting on their first two checks.\n\nAnyone eligible for a check who hasn't received their stimulus money from 2020 will receive the cash in the form of Recovery Rebate Credits once they file their 2020 federal taxes. However, if you're behind on certain debts, including child support and back taxes, you may get a smaller tax return than you expect depending on how much you owe.\n\nWhile the CARES Act only made the first $1,200 stimulus exempt from state and federal garnishment (with the exception of child support), the terms of the $900 billion Covid relief bill passed in December protected the second round of stimulus checks from garnishment by all creditors, including private ones.\n\nHowever, tax refunds are treated differently. If you're getting your stimulus payment in the form of a tax rebate, the amount may be reduced to pay debts owed. The Treasury Offset Program (TOP) is allowed to withhold money from your tax return for the following reasons:\n\nBack taxes owed from previous years\n\nPast-due federal student loans (currently suspended through Sept. 30, 2021)\n\nPast-due court-ordered child support payments\n\nOutstanding debts with federal agencies other than the IRS\n\nPast-due state income taxes\n\nAny unemployment compensation you must pay back\n\nThe IRS has agreed that it will not offset your stimulus rebate to pay for federal tax debts, but the agency cannot extend this discretion for state and other federal agencies.\n\nAs for upcoming payments, under the terms of the American Rescue Plan, your $1,400 stimulus check cannot be garnished for unpaid federal or state debt. However, the money may be garnished for unpaid private debts, such as medical bills or credit card debts, provided they are subject to a court order. And like with 2020 taxes, if you get your $1,400 stimulus check in the form of a tax rebate, the same offsets above could be possible.\n\nSome consumer advocacy and banking groups are calling on Congress to pass a standalone bill to make the latest stimulus payment exempt from garnishment. In a joint letter by the American Bankers Association, Americans for Financial Reform and other groups, consumer advocates argue that allowing garnishment impacts struggling families the most and fails to carry out the objective of stimulus payments in the first place.\n\nIf you're still awaiting your third stimulus payment, you may track it using the IRS Get My Payment site."}

And he made prosecutors provide addresses for about 27 witnesses that might actually be called, after they first submitted a witness list of 175 people.\n\nAt a hearing, which ran more than two hours, Schroeder said he would hold a separate pre-trial hearing next month about whether he'll allow testimony from use-of-force experts that both sides have indicated they want to call.\n\nThe trial itself remains set for Nov. 1.\n\nRittenhouse, now 18, is charged with fatally shooting two people and wounding a third \u2014 along with other lesser offenses \u2014 during violent protests in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020 after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. His lawyer says he acted in self defense.\n\nThe prosecution did reveal Friday that it has infrared video from an FBI airplane that they say shows Rittenhouse was chasing his first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, and said something to him before Rosenbaum then chased him, leading to the fatal encounter seconds later. The defense said it is obtaining the same video soon.\n\nAlso left undecided Friday was whether the estimated 150 or so people who will be summoned as possible jurors will be asked to fill out extensive questionnaires before the selection process begins.\n\nSchroeder, Wisconsin's longest serving sitting judge, said he disfavors questionnaires, and expressed concern it would tip recipients off that they could serve in the high-profile Rittenhouse trial \u2014 and might prompt even more talk about the case than has already been occurring in town.\n\nHe said someone even approached him in a grocery store and said they'd love to serve on the Rittenhouse jury, adding: \"Of course, that person will not.\"\n\nSchroeder said he's concerned about some of the questions lawyers have proposed concerning issues like support for certain political movements, guns, or memberships.\n\n\"This is not and won't be a political trial,\" he said.\n\nBut both sides urged him to use a questionnaire, to speed jury selection and help screen out people with the most strongly held views before they \"contaminate\" other potential jurors during traditional voir dire, where people in a group answer questions from lawyers in person.\n\nSchroeder seemed confident a jury could be selected in one day, without a questionnaire ahead of time, but said he'd revisit the matter and decide next week whether one \u2014 with limited queries \u2014 could be sent out.\n\nJudge rejects evidence on 'prior acts'\n\nAssistant District Attorney Thomas Binger argued repeatedly that three incidents involving Rittenhouse go \"to what I posit strong theory of case \u2014 that he's essentially a teen vigilante involving himself in things that don't concern him.\"\n\nOne video shows Rittenhouse striking a girl who was fighting with his sister in June 2020. One from Aug. 15, 2020 shows him and a friend watching from inside a car as people \u2014 whom Rittenhouse believes are looters \u2014 leave a CVS store across the street, while Rittenhouse says he wished he had his rifle so he could shoot at them. The still photos are of Rittenhouse posing with members of the Proud Boys at a Racine County tavern after a hearing in his case in January.\n\nBinger said he expects the defense to portray Rittenhouse as a community-minded altruist, so jurors need to hear about his other state of mind. \"It helps illuminate the truth for the jury,\" he said."}

Devotees to the deranged conspiracy theory, which holds that Trump has been waging a secret war on a Democratic cabal of cannibal sex traffickers, were among the crowd of MAGA extremists who stormed the Capitol earlier this month as lawmakers formalized Biden's victory. While the FBI did not identify any specific plots against the inauguration on the scale of that siege, it is warning that Q adherents have been scheming up ways to disrupt Wednesday's ceremony, including by exploiting vulnerabilities in the capital city's security blanket and by blending in with the more than 20,000 troops that have been mobilized. The bureau is also warning of \"lone wolf\" threats to the ceremony.\n\n\"We're monitoring all incoming leads, whether they're calls for armed protest, potential threats that grow out of the January 6 breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and in various other targets,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week.\n\nThe threats of further violence has already made for a tense transition of power.

Promise.\n\nThe Queen always, always puts the job first. Anyone with a base level of knowledge about the royals knows that family drama can't deter Queen Elizabeth II from prioritizing the monarchy, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal exit ~dramz~ was no exception.\n\nRoyal author Matthew Dennison breaks down the Queen's behind-the-scenes reaction to Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from royal life (and move across the pond to California) in his new book . In an early excerpt from the book (which is set to be released September 1) published by Us Weekly, Dennison said that \"Elizabeth was hurt and disappointed\" by the Sussexes' decision but she didn't let that affect her monarchy-first mindset.\n\n\"Elizabeth's official statement expressed loving finality: 'It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.' It was an attempt to reassert control in the interests of damage limitation and a decisive but dark beginning to a new decade,\" Dennison writes. \"Elizabeth had never been a sentimental woman; she had acted in the only way she understood.\"\n\nDennison also included a little context (you know, for any royal readers out there who haven't seen season 1 of The Crown) and explained why the Queen forced Harry and Meghan to make a clean break from royal duties instead of letting them continue to do some engagements.\n\n\"As throughout a life in which she had consistently honored her father's belief that 'the highest of distinctions is the service of others,' she had placed the monarchy first, safeguarding its mission of service and duty that could never, she was certain, be a part-time calling,\" he writes in the excerpt.\n\nOf course, it should go without saying (but maybe doesn't, so here we are, saying it explicitly) that \"putting the monarchy first\" and \"still loving and supporting Harry and Meghan\" are not mutually exclusive, and the Queen has made it abundantly clear that the latter is very much the case several times since the royal exit."}

I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we've made, and the work we have left to do.\n\nAnd it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has \u2014 COVID-19 \u2014 has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools.\n\nIf we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.\n\nIt will take a lot of hard work, and it's going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.\n\nYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I'm going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.\n\nFirst, we have cons- \u2014 we have made considerable progress\n\nin battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection.\n\nBefore I took office, we hadn't ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.\n\nAnd in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We're now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months.\n\nThis progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact.\n\nWe're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.\n\nWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks.\n\nThis is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it's caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they're ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable."}

Small numbers of U.S. special forces and CIA agents soon slip into Afghanistan to help direct the bombing campaign and organise Afghan opposition forces. the Taliban would swiftly be toppled, however, with no major U.S. combat deployment on the ground.\n\nNov. 13, 2001 - U.S.-backed Northern Alliance forces enter Kabul as the Taliban withdraw south. Within a month, Taliban leaders have fled from southern Afghanistan into Pakistan.\n\nDecember 2001 - U.S. forces bomb the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where bin Laden is reported to be hiding, but he slips over the border into Pakistan, where he disappears.\n\nMay 2, 2003 - U.S. officials declare an end to major combat operations in Afghanistan. Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. focus turns to preparing for the invasion of Iraq, which required a diversion of U.S. troops, equipment, and intelligence collection from Afghanistan. That allows the Taliban to slowly regroup, at first in the south and east.\n\n2006-2008 - With U.S. forces mainly fighting a surge campaign in Iraq, only a much smaller contingent is deployed in Afghanistan. The Taliban launch major advances threatening to recapture swaths of territory, especially in the south. In response, an enlarged NATO mission brings thousands more troops, notably British forces, hundreds of whom are killed in intense battles against the Taliban in Helmand province."}

The store was fully stocked, and more importantly, had functioning lights and heat. The fifty-year-old graphic designer found the same at the Food King store he visited afterward. Besides having to step over residual snow sludge on streets and sidewalks, El Pasoans like Gomez were experiencing few aftereffects of a historic winter storm that brought the city subfreezing temperatures and three inches of snow and ice.\n\nScrolling through Twitter that same day, Gomez found himself wishing he could do something to help when he saw pictures and videos of what so many fellow Texans were experiencing\u2014bursting pipes, falling ceilings, flooding, and freezing homes. \"TEXAS! Head west, far west,\" he tweeted. \"Our grid is up in El Paso, and we welcome anyone that needs a respite from this frigid chaos. Hotels, shelters, and hope.\"\n\nWhen the winter storms that paralyzed most of Texas first blew through El Paso on February 14, only about 3,000 people in the city had a power outage in their homes, and more than 2,000 of those saw their power restored within just five minutes. No homes in this city of 682,000 residents spent days without power or heat\u2014an experience common to millions throughout the rest of the state. Although this winter storm didn't hit El Paso as severely as it did other parts of the state, the conditions were similar to those during a February 2011 storm that devastated the city. It's thanks to the preparations that El Paso made in response to that disaster, as well as its operating on a different electric grid than the majority of Texas, that the city had a starkly different experience during the last awful week for the state.\n\nBecause of the vast distance that separates El Paso from Texas's other major population centers, and because its customer base includes parts of southern New Mexico, the power supply of the city's public utility isn't linked to the grid overseen by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages about 90 percent of the state's electric load. Instead, it's connected to the Western Interconnection grid, which spans fourteen states in the West, along with parts of Canada and Mexico. As a consequence, when the winter freeze hit Texas, El Paso Electric had a sizable safety net. In addition to its local plants, it drew on Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona to meet the surge in customer demand as people cranked up their thermostats.\n\nMeanwhile, ERCOT's grid purposefully remains within the state's boundaries in order to avoid federal energy regulations. When power it was counting on from wind, nuclear, and natural gas sources was adversely affected by the wintry conditions, ERCOT couldn't fall back on help from neighboring states. \"There's been a tremendous amount of supply disruptions,\" said Steve Buraczyk, El Paso Electric's senior vice president of operations. \"It's difficult for them to try to deal with that just within ERCOT.\"\n\nThe other big difference for El Paso Electric is that all of its power plants were outfitted for a deep freeze. After that February 2011 storm, hundreds of thousands of the utility's customers were left without power for extended periods. In the years since, it has spent millions to prepare for the next extreme winter event, including $4.5 million on adapting many of its existing facilities for prolonged operation in freezing temperatures. The winterization of a power plant is similar to preparing your house for winter, except much more expensive. Valves, transmitters, and pipelines, along with other areas of a plant that could be affected by freezing temperatures, have insulation added or heat lamps installed nearby."}

This speaks volumes about our industry because, in this event, this only got attention because it involved an A-list actor like Alec Baldwin.\"\n\nCameron Kasky, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland mass shooting and gun control activist, agrees with Albuliwi. \"All real guns should be banned from sets,\" he says. \"Fake guns look very real. If studios have even the slightest regard for workers, real guns would be completely out of the question.\"\n\nFor decades, real firearms with blank ammunition have been used in film and TV productions because they visually recreate actual gunfire. But in discussions with industry insiders and visual effects experts, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, many said that advances in visual effects technology mean banning real weapons would result in virtually no sacrifice to the look and feel of a finished piece of content.\n\n\"If in the background, there's a dinosaur running around, you know, that's where the money is,\" said one longtime VFX artist. \"A couple of 'bang bang, smoky smoky' things is a sneeze compared to almost anything else.\"\n\nOften times, there is minimal lifting required in post-production to make a fake gun look as if it has been discharged, experts said. A \"muzzle flash,\" or the appearance of smoke and light from the barrel of a gun, is easily created with software used by editors and digital intermediate houses.\n\n\"Doing just a muzzle flash, it's nothing,\" says the effects artist. \"It's minutes of work per shot \u2014 maybe a tiny glow, maybe a tiny bit of interactive light.\"\n\nMore elaborate sequences involving gunfire, especially those that involve an actor flinching in reaction to an overpowering weapon, could necessitate more intensive visual effects work.\n\n\"It's essentially performance modification, and that's what would move it to the next level,\" says the artist.\n\nBut even in these cases, this artist notes these are actions an actor \"can absolutely mimic\" in their performance.\n\nTaking real firearms off a set would also remove potential lethal hazards caused by the kind of negligence that's been alleged to have occurred on \"Rust\" \u2014 from union crews walking and the hiring of scabs, to improper protocols handling weaponry. Veterans in the production coordination space, basically those in charge of \"Hollywood's back office\" as one put it, said that standard safety protocols often go overlooked, particularly on productions outside entertainment's backyard in Los Angeles.\n\n\"West Coast unions require safety classes through CSATF,\" said one top production coordinator, referring to the digital portal Contract Services, which provides training and other functions for film and TV shoots.\n\nThrough Contract Services, employees take state-mandated courses like sexual harassment education and, of course, safety training. These union-mandated program also issues daily safety bulletins with the production call sheet, briefing the entire production on the stunts and other hazards of the day.\n\n\"We're supposed to check the status of each and every union crew member before they are hired,\" says the coordinator. \"This isn't nationwide and people don't often use it.\"\n\nThese issues speak to a larger, more pernicious attitude involving on-set safety and wellbeing \u2014 and a culture of silence that has kept people from speaking up."}

Below, the hosts talk about the origin of the nightly \"handoff\" between their shows and how it put their friendship in front of the camera.\n\nDon Lemon: Our new podcast is called \"The Handoff\" because on TV each night you get to hand-off to me when you end Cuomo Prime Time and I start Don Lemon Tonight. How lucky are you?\n\nChris Cuomo: I consider myself blessed to have you in my life on and off the TV. I do think it is fundamentally dishonest of us to not tell people how completely random this moment is on TV each night. It has never been given a name until now. It has never been produced, and it has only been discouraged. But, everybody talks to us about it and now here we are with our own podcast!\n\nDon Lemon: Honestly, Chris, we're fearless in those moments because we are really vulnerable. And I think you always have my back and I know I always have yours. But that doesn't mean that it's going to be an agree-fest. Am I wrong?\n\nChris Cuomo: I think that's 100 percent accurate. What's the blessing? The blessing is that we're actually friends. A lot of stuff in the media is phony. A lot of couples that you see on news shows, they are friendly for the purpose of the show, and that's neither good nor bad. It is not the case with us.\n\nDon Lemon: What's been most interesting to me is that I've always been friends with people who are different than me. And you have the same sort of thing. All of your friends that I know, they don't really look like you. They don't really act like you. They come from different backgrounds and the same thing for me.\n\nChris Cuomo: We both have been doing this a long time and I've worked with plenty of people that I've liked but I've never spent as much time off television with somebody as you and I do together and there's a real treat in that.\n\nUnless something really crazy happens in the next 10, 15 years, I think this is the most interesting and recordable part of our professional lives. We've never seen this kind of political maelstrom and upheaval, not in our lifetimes.\n\nDon Lemon: And we'll see what happens next. They wanted a handoff. They got a handoff.\n\nAnd let me just say this: my favorite time of the day, besides the time that I spend with my fianc\u00e9 and with my family, and my dog, is that moment that where you and I are about to talk to each other, and we don't know what we're going to say.\n\nChris Cuomo: Never.\n\nDon Lemon: And if we agree or disagree, we always go away at the end of our talk by saying what?\n\nChris Cuomo: I love you, D.

They are producing more rainfall, moving slower once they make landfall and generating larger storm surges along the coast. Hurricane Ida was a prime example of those changes, and scientists say storms like this will become more common as the planet warms.\n\nFueled by warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ida destroyed homes, uprooted trees and cut off power to more than 1 million residents. It battered Mississippi and the already storm-ravaged state of Louisiana, and officials there say they expect the death toll to increase in the coming days.\n\nHurricane Ida was just the latest in back-to-back storms that have slammed Louisiana in recent years. But Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and professor at Texas Tech University, said an important distinction is not the frequency of the storms but their severity.\n\n\"We've always had hurricanes, we've always had heat waves, we've always had floods and droughts, but what climate change is doing is loading the weather dice against us,\" Hayhoe told CNN. \"It's sneaking in when we're not looking, changing the numbers as we're rolling and asking what is this, how could this happen?\"\n\n\"The answer to that is climate change,\" she said.\n\nHurricanes are getting stronger\n\nHurricanes \u2014 also called tropical cyclones or typhoons outside North America \u2014 are being made more intense by the warming ocean, which studies have shown has absorbed approximately 90% of the planet's excess heat trapped by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. And a recent study found that the planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat than it did nearly 15 years ago.\n\nAs the planet heats up, storms get stronger.\n\nThe recent state-of-the-science United Nations report on climate change concluded that the global proportion of cyclones ranging from Category 3 to 5 \u2014 the most intense storms \u2014 has increased over the last four decades due to rapidly warming ocean temperatures. For every additional degree of warmth, scientists say not only will the proportion of intense cyclones continue to climb, but extreme rain events are also forecast to intensify by about 7%.\n\n\"We know that, in general, hurricanes are intensifying faster,\" Hayhoe said. \"They are bigger and stronger than they would be otherwise; they have a lot more rainfall associated with them, and rising sea level exacerbates storm surge.\"\n\nBefore making landfall on Sunday, Hurricane Ida went through a remarkable period of strengthening: its maximum sustained winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours.\n\nScientists define rapid intensification \u2014 a process that historically has been rare \u2014 as an increase of 35 mph in 24 hours or less. Hurricane Ida nearly doubled that definition.\n\nFor rapid intensification to occur, warm ocean water must extend well below the surface, going hundreds of feet deep, to provide enough engine for the hurricane to strengthen. This has led scientists to believe that storms are more likely to undergo rapid intensification as a result of warmer oceans.\n\n\"If you increase the speed limit, you make more room for the storms to strengthen, so it can intensify more quickly,\" Jim Kossin, a senior scientist with the Climate Service, an organization that provides climate risk analysis to governments and businesses, told CNN.\n\nIda made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4, and is now tied in the record books with Laura in 2020 as the strongest hurricane to make landfall there.\n\nHurricanes are wetter and moving slower\n\nHighway 51 was flooded on Monday by Hurricane Ida near LaPlace, Louisiana. Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advert/USA TODAY Network\n\nStorms are also generating more rainfall. For every degree of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7% more water vapor that could fall as rain. After flooding from Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017, scientists found that human-caused climate change supercharged the storm's rainfall by approximately 15%.\n\nHurricane Ida has dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Louisiana, according to the National Weather Service. As the remnants of the storm arc from the South to New England, another 3 to 7 inches of rain is expected across at least 12 states, including areas already impacted by severe flooding this month such as Tennessee and New Jersey.\n\nPaul Miller, a coastal meteorology scientists at Louisiana State University, said southeast Louisiana, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, experienced one of its wettest seasons on record. According to Miller, it rained on 91% of the days between June 18 and July 19 at the New Orleans airport, compared to the region's average of 40-50%.\n\n\"It's been a historically wet year in southeast Louisiana even before Ida,\" he told CNN. \"This really exacerbated concerns about flooding during Ida because the ground had already absorbed a lot of water this year.\"\n\nSatellite data also shows that storms are getting slower, particularly after they make landfall, according to Hayhoe. Slower and larger storms means they can cover a greater area, idle and dump more rain during that time period.\n\nAnd, while experts say the research is still developing, a 2020 study published in the journal Nature found storms are staying stronger farther inland than they did five decades ago. Since hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, they tend to weaken over land, but in recent years they have been raging longer after landfall. The study concludes that warmer sea surface temperatures are leading to a \"slower decay\" by increasing the amount of moisture that a hurricane can carry.\n\nStorm surge is getting higher\n\nStorm surge, the flooding that occurs when hurricane winds push ocean water over land, is also getting worse due to sea level rise. Hayhoe said storm surge can inundate a larger area now than it would from a hurricane of the same intensity about 50 or 100 years ago."}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAlex Khmelevskiy, the head of UX design at Clay \u2014 a design and branding agency based out of San Francisco \u2014 examined Citigroup's wire transfer and said the mistake could have been easily avoided with a more user friendly interface.\n\n\"The UI looks like it came from the early '90s, which is a problem on its own,\" Khmelevskiy told Insider.\n\nCitigroup Revlon payment on Flexcube Court filing\n\nA Citigroup spokesperson told Insider the company is working to update its loan operations platform.\n\n\"We take pride in the role that we play as a global leader in financial services and recognize that an operational error of this nature is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson told Insider. \"We have put significant, additional controls in place until the new system is operational.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the interface provider, Oracle, declined to comment.\n\nFederal judge Jesse Furman ruled last week that Citigroup will not be able to recoup half a billion dollars of its own money after it accidentally sent Revlon creditors nearly $1 billion.\n\nCitigroup made the costly mistake over the summer. Instead of transferring a $7.8 million interest payment to the cosmetic company's lenders, the bank transferred the full loan amount.\n\nThe bank notified the creditors within 24 hours that it had not intended to pay the full amount, which was not due until 2023. Some firms returned the money, but 10 others refused to return about $500 million of the funds, prompting Citigroup's failed lawsuit to recoup the payment.\n\nThe blunder was the result of the failure to check the right boxes for the wire transfer\n\nCitigroup \u2014 like many commercial banks \u2014 uses Flexcube, a third-party application system from Oracle designed to help perform tasks like wire transfers.\n\nCitigroup subcontractors are responsible for entering the transaction information into the Flexcube database in order to initiate the transfer process.\n\nOn Flexcube, the easiest way to perform a transaction is to enter the principal amount into the system. The principal amount is directed to a \"wash account\" within the bank, while the payment triggers the interest to be sent out automatically to lenders.\n\nFor the Revlon payment, the subcontractor in India checked the box labeled \"principal\" and entered the digits for an internal Citigroup wash account. Three people signed off on the transaction.\n\n\"Looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash,\" the supervisor wrote when he approved the transaction, according to the court filing.\n\nThe mistake was not realized till the next morning when the full amount was sent out to the 10 different creditors.\n\nIt turned out, the subcontractor needed to check two more boxes. In order to send the principal payment to the wash account, the subcontractor must also check the boxes for \"front\" and \"fund,\" setting them to the internal Citigroup account as well.\n\n\"Minor changes\" to Flexcube could have spared the bank from the blunder altogether\n\nKhmelevskiy's agency has worked with several large scale tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Slack. He said there are many ways the platform could have been improved to avoid the $500 million mistake.\n\n\"Even if we put the look and feel aside, just adding more clear instructions for each field and using more human-friendly language and terms would improve it drastically,\" Khmelevskiy said. \"Even a minor change such as a confirmation dialog with an overview of what is about to happen could help Citi avoid making this mistake.\"\n\nIn his decision, the judge said he hoped other banks would learn from Citigroup's mistake and implement more steps to minimize the risk of errors \u2014 an accident which the judge calls the result of a \"fat finger.\"\n\nThe judge based his ruling off a previous case, stating that it was reasonable for the creditors to keep the funds because they matched what the lenders were owed.\n\n\"To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion \u2014 would have been borderline irrational\" Furman said in the ruling."}

Jerry Nadler, D-New York, called the outcome \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest,\" he wrote.\n\nPart of that statement -- the claim Rittenhouse was armed when he crossed state lines -- was repeated by many in the wake of the verdict.\n\nBut that information is wrong.\n\nTweet vs. reality\n\nWhen asked for backup, Nadler spokesperson Dan Rubin said the tweet was trying to make the point that Rittenhouse could be open to further review by the U.S. Department of Justice because he crossed state lines to be in Wisconsin for the protests.\n\nThe tweet, Rubin said, wasn't meant to convey that Rittenhouse had taken the gun itself over state lines, arguing that the situation \"at least opens up the possibility of a broader review from DOJ.\"\n\nBut that's not what the tweet says. It suggests Rittenhouse brought the gun to Wisconsin, when testimony said he did not.\n\n(To be sure, there was plenty of controversy around the fact he had a gun, and Rittenhouse initially faced a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully possessing the gun as a minor. Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless they fall under an exception, such as for hunting. For months, Rittenhouse's attorneys pointed to one of those exceptions that they argued allows 16- and 17-year-olds to carry rifles and shotguns as long as they are not unlawfully short-barreled. Prosecutors acknowledged the gun was not short-barreled, after which the judge tossed the charge.)\n\nDuring the trial, Dominick Black, a close friend, testified that he agreed to purchase the gun for Rittenhouse, according to a Nov. 2, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report.\n\nBlack used money Rittenhouse gave him to make the purchase in Wisconsin, knowing the purchase was illegal. Rittenhouse and Black agreed that Rittenhouse wouldn't get the gun himself until he turned 18.\n\nRittenhouse did shoot the weapon several times the weekend it was purchased while up north at Black's family hunting property in May 2020, the Journal Sentinel report said.\n\nBlack testified that normally, the AR-15 was stored in Black's home in Kenosha, locked up in a gun safe. The safe could only be opened by Black's stepfather. But the night of the unrest, the guns were taken out of the safe and into the basement.\n\nSome time after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020, he retrieved the gun from Black's basement and went into the downtown area.\n\n(A final note: Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted, Black is asking that charges against him related to buying the gun be thrown out. A decision on that has been delayed.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nLike many others, Nadler said in a tweet following Rittenhouse's acquittal that the teen had traveled across state lines with a firearm."}

Prosecutors said Chansley entered the Senate chamber with a group of about 25 rioters, posed for pictures at the dais where then-Vice President Mike Pence had been minutes before, and left a note that read, \"It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.\"\n\nThe following day, prosecutors say Chansley called the FBI Washington field office, admitted his involvement and described Pence as a \"child-trafficking traitor,\" but said he did not intend the note to be a threat. When asked about the meaning of the note, he launched into a \"lengthy diatribe\" describing current and past lawmakers including Pence, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden as \"infiltrators involved in various types of wrongdoing.\"\n\nChansley told investigators he came to the Capitol \"at the request of the president that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6,\" according to court records."}

It was recorded as 8 minutes, 46 seconds in an initial criminal complaint \u2014 a figure that became symbolic to many in the weeks after Floyd's death \u2014 before a math error was corrected to make it 7:46. But filings since then, citing time-stamped police body-camera video, now make it at least nine minutes.\n\nThe fact that the figure has evolved probably won't matter at Chauvin's trial, which begins Monday with jury selection. One former prosecutor says it's common for such details to be fine-tuned as prosecutors build a case. A support group for victims of police violence says the discrepancies won't have any impact.\n\n\"He was obviously on there enough time to think about what he was doing. He heard the man pleading that he couldn't breathe,\" said Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. \"If it was two minutes or if it was five minutes or if it was 10 minutes, he was fully aware ... Once he said, 'I cannot breathe' ... he was supposed to remove his knee.\"\n\nFloyd died May 25. He had been handcuffed and was pleading that he couldn't breathe, but Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck even after he stopped moving and speaking.\n\nChauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers \u2014 Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao \u2014 are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled for trial in August.\n\nThe narrative in the initial complaint filed May 29 by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office says Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds. But the time stamps cited in that charging document indicate it was actually 7 minutes, 46 seconds.\n\nThe Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors repeatedly declined to address it. The 8:46 detail was repeated in an amended complaint filed days later by the Attorney General's Office.\n\nIn the weeks that followed Floyd's death, some demonstrators staged \"die-ins\" that lasted 8 minutes, 46 seconds, some lawmakers knelt for that amount of time in the U.S. Senate, and mourners at a memorial service for Floyd stood in silence for 8:46 to reflect on the final moments of his life.\n\nIn mid-June, prosecutors acknowledged the one-minute error, but said it would have no impact on the case.\n\nDocuments filed by prosecutors in September and October changed the timing yet again. These documents contain the most detailed picture of what happened, citing time stamps from Lane, Keung and Thao's body camera videos.\n\nThe documents don't list an exact time for when Chauvin began kneeling on Floyd, but instead provide a narrative for when Floyd was first pressed to the ground. Time stamps on video from Lane's body camera \u2014 recorded in 24-hour-clock format \u2014 show that began at some point from 20:19:14 to 20:19:45, meaning from 14 to 45 seconds after 8:19 p.m.\n\nBut the documents cite a clear moment when Chauvin removed his knee, when a stretcher was ready to take Floyd away. Lane's body camera time-stamp read 20:28:45."}

The airbags had been deployed and initial evidence indicated the driver had been wearing a seat belt.\n\nSeveral of Daniel's personal effects including clothes, a cellphone, wallet and keys were also found in the vehicle.\n\nLater that month, on July 31, a human skull was found in an area south of where the Jeep was found, however subsequent tests determined that it was not Daniel's.\n\nInvestigators have ruled out the possibility of foul play due to the damage sustained by Daniel's car.\n\nHis father, David Robinson II, has traveled from his home in South Carolina to continue the search for answers and has set up a GoFundMe page to pay for a private investigator along with flyers, continued searches and other expenses.\n\n\"Daniel has an innate passion for adventure and is known to travel inopportune moments,\" a statement on the GoFundMe page reads. \"However, he always communicates with friends and family about his travel plans.\"\n\nMore than $34,000 has been raised so far with David pledging to stay on \"indefinitely until we have answers and bring Daniel home safely.\"\n\nThe fundraiser has been set up because \"the current investigation by law enforcement is not progressing.\"\n\nMissing man Daniel Robinson - the 24-year-old was last seen leaving a worksite on June 23.

The campaign is also calling on Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the new World Health Organization-backed transfer hub based in South Africa.\n\nThis certainly won't be the first time The Duke and Duchess have raised their voices about the issue of vaccine equity. As co-chairs of Global Citizen's VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World in May \u2014 which called on world leaders, corporations, and philanthropists to ensure vaccines are available to all \u2014 they penned an open letter to Big Pharma CEOs, calling on them to urgently share COVID-19 vaccines with the world's poorest countries.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health, social, and economic inequality globally,\" they wrote. \"The global vaccine rollout thus far further deepens these disparities, with the poorest and most marginalized populations most adversely impacted.\"\n\nAnd to celebrate their son Archie's second birthday, they led a global fundraising effort to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility to get vaccines to people in low-income countries who need them most. The initiative \u2014 thanks in part to donations matched by Mastercard Impact Fund, Seadream Family Foundation, and a public charity \u2014 ultimately mobilized $3.5 million.\n\n\"The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography,\" Prince Harry said on the VAX LIVE stage. \"It must be accepted as a basic right for all and that is our starting point.\"\n\nMonths later, vaccine equity remains a dire issue. Coronavirus variants are spreading across the world, people in poor nations still can't access vaccinations or treatments, and rich countries continue to hoard vaccines as they move forward with COVID-19 booster plans (despite the World Health Organization and other health experts saying such plans at this stage will only exacerbate extreme vaccine inequity). The Duke and Duchess' message is sure to be one world leaders need to hear.\n\nAdditional appearances announced Tuesday for the global broadcast event include United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley, Education Cannot Wait Director Yasmine Sherif, Namati CEO Vivek Maru, Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones, SDG Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee President Trisha Shetty, Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., UN Next Generation Fellow Valeria Colunga, advocate Eunice Akoth, and more.\n\nAs part of our year-long Recovery Plan for the World campaign, Global Citizen Live will showcase a day of unity spanning seven continents, bringing together more than 70 artists, activists, and world leaders to defend the planet and defeat poverty."}

The two sides seem a long way away from resolving the issue.\n\nAnd caught in the middle of this legal battle is the cargo, with an estimated value of some $1bn, the owners of which have no say.\n\nIndeed, North European importers with containers onboard the Ever Given may have already decided to abandon the cargo, due to the time-sensitive nature of product, contracts of sale being frustrated and/or markets having been lost.\n\nSingapore-based Mathu Jagannath, director of marine claims consultancy firm NAU Pte, has urged SCA and shipowner to consider the cargo interests.\n\n\"The longer this saga continues, the greater will be the losses arising out of the incident,\" he said. \"We urge all the parties to consider all the options available to deal with this issue, including the release of the vessel from arrest so it can continue with its voyage.\"\n\nHe also recommended that cargo interests be \"proactive and participate\" in any action relating to the release of the ship.\n\nThe SCA blames the accident on the ship's \"excessive speed\" at the time of the grounding, while the vessel's insurer, the UK's P&I Club, maintains that navigation in the waterway was under the control of the SCA's pilots and vessel traffic management.\n\nThe P&I Club said these controls included the speed of the transit and the availability of tugs.\n\nThe shipowner has declared General Average, meaning cargo owners must pay a percentage of the value of their consignment towards the salvage costs before the release of containers, but the process cannot be completed until the ship is able to discharge its boxes.\n\nAccording to vesselsvalue, the 2018-built Ever Given is worth $183m, having increased its value by around $13m since it ran aground by keeping with spiralling asset values in the container sector.\n\nIt is not known whether its operator, Evergreen, which has leased the vessel on a long-term charter, is still paying daily hire, although one broker source said he thought the carrier would still be responsible for the charter, despite the ship being under arrest.\n\nMoreover, with containership capacity in such short supply and demand remaining high, Evergreen will be keen to get the ship back into service as soon as possible."}

A search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve in Florida has been suspended.\n\nUWO student Miranda Baker took to TikTok to say she and her boyfriend picked up a hitchhiker at Grand Teton National Park on August 29.

I said hop in. He hops in the back of my Jeep. We then proceeded to make small talk. Before he came into the car he offered to pay us like, $200 to give him a ride, like 10 miles. So that was kind of weird. He then told us he's been camping for multiple days without his fianc\u00e9e. He did say he had a fianc\u00e9e, and that she was working on their social media page back at their van. In conversation, I brought up that we're going to Jackson. He freaked out. He's like 'nope, I need to get out right now, you know, pull over.' So we pulled over at the Jackson Dam. It's not very far from Colter Bay.\"\n\nBaker said Laundrie \"had scruff, but didn't look dirty.\" She found that strange because he said he had been camping.\n\nShe says they dropped Laundrie off at 6:09 p.m. on Aug. 29. He told them he was going to find someone else to hitch a ride.\n\nBaker did another video mapping out the area where they picked up Laundrie.\n\nSeveral days later, on Sept. 1, Laundrie returned home to North Port, Florida. He and Gabby lived with his parents there.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Petito's family reported her missing. Laundrie chose not to cooperate with authorities.\n\nOn Sept. 17, police and the FBI announce that Laundrie is missing and his family saw him three days prior to that date.\n\nOn Sept. 19, searchers find the body of a woman in northern Wyoming.

The bell, situated atop a square tube extending aboveground from an opening at the coffin's head, was connected to a rope that dangled down the tube into the coffin. The ladder similarly extended down the tube. If the corpse chose to rejoin the living, it could climb up the ladder. Should that prove too much of a strain, it could instead ring the bell to halloo for assistance.\n\nGo ahead and laugh at Vester's contraption (inspired perhaps by publication of Edgar Allen Poe's 1844 story, \"The Premature Burial\"). But something very much like it has been erected over the past half-century by government at the state and federal levels in the United States. The chief difference is that instead of helping to resurrect the deceased's body, these ingenious new inventions help to resurrect the deceased's money, granting it virtual and in some cases literal immortality. Never in our lifetimes has it been such an attractive prospect to be fabulously rich and dead.\n\nNever in our lifetimes has it been such an attractive prospect to be fabulously rich and dead.\n\nThe changes in recent decades to government policies affecting inheritance herald a massive, largely unremarked redistribution of wealth in America\u2014one that President Joe Biden tried to slow this past spring, only to have his proposed reform rejected by his fellow Democrats. (More on that below.) It's widely understood that the wealthiest one percent saw its share of the nation's wealth increase from 30 percent in 1989 to 39 percent in 2016. That was driven by the trend in rising income inequality starting in the late 1970s. But as today's millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha (that's babies born since 2010) enter middle age, there's a decent chance wealth inequality will be driven less by unequal income than by unequal inheritance. That's because we're about to witness the largest transfer of wealth that the United States has ever known."}

The arrangement was not revealed until after the not-guilty verdict was handed down on Friday.\n\nCarlson shared a promo video on Friday night that showed his crew filming with Rittenhouse during the trial, featuring the 18-year-old in a wholly sympathetic light.\n\nThe crew was in an SUV with Rittenhouse immediately after the verdict was announced. A staffer could be heard off-camera asking \"How you feel, man?\" Rittenhouse answered, \"The jury reached the correct verdict. Self-defense is not illegal. And I believe they came to the correct verdict.\"\n\nFox announced that Carlson \"will conduct an exclusive interview\" with Rittenhouse, with a portion airing on Monday night, \"followed by a Tucker Carlson Originals documentary on Fox Nation in December.\"\n\nSo the behind-the-scenes footage is for the documentary, and this entire tragedy is being used to drive subscriptions for Fox's streaming service.\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo asked Rittenhouse attorney Mark Richards about the Carlson promo on Friday night.

The attorney said he wasn't opposed to Fox specifically; he was opposed to any TV crew presence.

This casual image of the first female vice president drew considerable criticism for failing to capture Harris in a pose and outfit more appropriate for her historic position in American government. Anna Wintour, Vogue editor-in-chef, and others defended the cover picture by noting that this image best reflects the events of the moment\u2014but has now announced a re-do, with a new limited edition cover for Kamala Harris as a result of the widespread backlash. The cover photo controversy is much more than a disagreement over a styling choice. Madam Vice-President's racial identity is central to understanding why some take exception to this cover. Black women's bodies are political. Their styling choices have cultural meanings that are deeply rooted in cultural norms that carry the legacies of racism, sexism, and respectability politics. Thus, the uproar over Kamala Harris's Vogue cover must be read through a socio-cultural lens that acknowledges the intersectional salience of her racialized and gendered body.\n\nOutside of her historic victory, Kamala Harris's appearance also affords her some possibilities, such as this Vogue cover, not open to other Black women candidates. This multi-ethnic Black woman was once called the \"best-looking attorney general in the country\" by President Barack Obama. She's also appeared on the Hill's 50 Most Beautiful list. Contrast the recognition of Kamala Harris' beauty to the experiences of Stacey Abrams. The former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and founder of Fair Fight plainly stated to the co-hosts of The Breakfast Club, a syndicated hip-hop/urban radio show based in New York City, that \"They [doubters] don't think I'm viable, because I'm a Black woman with natural hair.\" Harris and Abrams have received differential treatment that is not shaped by their political ideologies, fitness for an elected position, nor their ability to represent constituents."}

Though it's common for courtrooms to use a lottery-type system to draw jurors or alternate jurors, it's often the courtroom clerk who physically draws the jurors' numbers.\n\n\"I am now reading about how bizarre and unusual it was to have the defendant pick numbers out of the tumbler yesterday,\" Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder said Wednesday, adding that he has made it standard practice to do so since a trial he oversaw in Racine, Wisconsin, roughly 20 years ago.\n\nSchroeder said the defendant in the Racine case was Black, and there was only one Black person in the pool of 13 jurors. He said when the clerk or government official drew the alternate, it happened to be the lone Black juror.\n\n\"There was nothing wrong with it \u2014 it was all okay, but what do they talk about? Optics nowadays? Is that the word for things? It was a bad optic, I thought,\" Schroeder said. \"I think people feel better when they have control, so ever since that case, I've had an almost universal policy of having the defendant do the picks.\"\n\nSchroeder noted that he'd never received a complaint about the practice \u2014 nor did he receive any pushback from the prosecutors or defense attorneys when he allowed Rittenhouse to draw the jurors. He suggested that some viewers of the trial \u2014 which has been streamed live in its entirety \u2014 were simply using the incident as an excuse to cast doubt on the eventual verdict.\n\n\"Some people seem to be dissatisfied with that.

Schroeder began discussing various complaints he'd read in the media about his decisions, including his decision to bar people from using the word \"victims\" to describe the men Rittenhouse shot \u2014 a standard rule upheld in courtrooms across the country."}

For one film expert, the tragedy underscores the importance of training and oversight during sequences involving firearms.\n\n\"With the sets I work on, I work with very large crowds, up to 500 people,\" Paul Biddiss, a former British Army paratrooper turned-military advisor, told Task & Purpose. \"Weapons safety is always going to be paramount when you're working with any sort of weapon.\"\n\nBaldwin, a producer and the star of the western film \"Rust,\" fired a prop gun while filming at Bonanza Creek Ranch, in Santa Fe County, around 1:50 p.m. on Thursday, killing Halyna Hutchins, 42, the film's director of photography, and injuring director Joel Souza, 48.\n\n\"This investigation remains open and active,\" the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. \"No charges have been filed in regard to this incident. Witnesses continue to be interviewed by detectives.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that the shooting took place during a scene that was either being actively filmed or was rehearsed.\n\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" Baldwin said after the incident, adding that he was \"fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\nSuch incidents are rare in the film industry due to extensive safety protocols typically followed during film sequences involving firearms, and has resulted in a flurry of discussion about safety measures on set when firearms are used.\n\nTo get a better sense of those safety protocols, Task & Purpose spoke with Biddiss, who served 24 years in the British Army before segueing to a career as a military advisor in film and television. Biddiss has worked on numerous action, and firearms-heavy projects, from the World War I epic \"1917\" to the crime caper \"Wrath of Man\" and \"Fury,\" which followed a tank crew in World War II.\n\nWhile some sets use prop weapons that don't fire anything at all, many of the weapons used are actual firearms that have been modified to fire only blanks, Biddiss said. Blank ammunition has all the components of a normal round, except for the projectile, and the shell casing is crimped at the round's tip.\n\nBut even though a weapon can only fire blanks, they can still be dangerous, and so film crews take extensive steps to ensure safety protocols are adhered to.\n\n\"Although they're blanks, there are still bits and pieces that will come out \u2014 sparks and bits of dust that will fly out, and some pressure,\" Bidess said. \"A blank can actually do you a huge amount of damage. If it was pressed right up against your head, it could probably kill you.\"\n\nWhen filming with semi- and fully automatic weapons that are gas-operated, meaning the combustion gas from firing a round is what reloads the weapon, the barrel typically has a mechanism called a \"restrictor.\" Restrictors function similarly to the blank-firing adapters (BFAs) used in the military, except that the device is internal, rather than attached to the exterior of the muzzle.\n\n\"They have it down the barrel to conceal that there's an actual restrictor,\" said Biddiss. \"That helps to recycle the rounds so you've got the automatic effect and the recoil and everything else.\"\n\nDevices like BFAs or restrictors do two things: they help prevent debris from escaping the barrel through the muzzle when a blank round is fired; and they help the weapon chamber another round by preventing the combustion gases from escaping the barrel."}

But many are skeptical, and Britain's foreign minister stressed the importance of engaging with the new rulers to test their promises.\n\nIn a reflection of those anxieties, dozens of women protested outside the governor's office in the western province of Herat to demand their rights be protected. They shouted slogans and urged the country's new leaders to include women in their Cabinet \u2014 a remarkable demonstration of the transformation in women's lives in the past 20 years.\n\nWhen they last held power in the late 1990s, the Taliban imposed a repressive rule, meting out draconian punishments and largely excluding women from public life. On Thursday, Taliban fighters prevented the female demonstrators from seeing the governor as they demanded, but they did not break up the rally.\n\nAmid uncertainty about Afghanistan's future, tens of thousands raced to flee the country in a frantic U.S.-run airlift that ended ahead of the final American withdrawal earlier this week. A suicide bomber targeted the evacuation efforts at one point, killing 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members.\n\nKabul's airport, a major way out of the country, is now in Taliban hands but is closed, and Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammad bin Abdulrahman Al Thani warned Thursday that there's still \"no clear indication\" of when it will reopen.\n\nA team of Qatari and Turkish technicians flew to Kabul on Wednesday to help restart operations at the facility, which the U.N. says is crucial to providing the country with humanitarian assistance.

This one comes courtesy of royal biographer and expert Andrew Morton, who is currently making the rounds doing tons of Sussex-specific press to promote the updated paperback edition of his book .\n\nAccording to Morton, Harry and Meghan passed on a title for their son because of fears that Archie might be bullied if they accepted. Apparently, this was not a general, kids-pick-on-royals fear and a much more specific concern because of the title Archie was in line to inherit.\n\n\"[Archie] could have taken the title 'the Earl of Dumbarton,' which is an honorary title, but [Harry and Meghan] decided against that because they felt that the word 'dumb' in the word 'Dumbarton' would have been used as mockery when Archie went to school,\" Morton told Us Weekly of the Sussexes' supposed reasoning.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in addition to the reason being up for debate, the entire question of whether or not Harry and Meghan were even given a say in Archie's status as a titled royal\u2014honorary or otherwise\u2014is a bit contentious. While early reports did suggest that the couple had made the decision to raise Archie without a title, Meghan offered a much different version of events earlier this year during the Sussexes' sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"They didn't want him to be a prince or a princess, which would be different from protocol,\" Meghan said during the interview. \"It was really hard....This went on for the last few months of our pregnancy where I'm going, 'Hold on a second. How does that work? If he's not gonna be a prince, he needs to be safe.'\"\n\nOf course, Meghan was referring to the possibility of Archie being named a prince, while Morton is discussing an honorary earl title, so it's possible that both of these things are true\u2014i.e., that the Royal Powers That Be denied making Archie a prince and that Harry and Meghan then passed on the honorary title on his behalf."}

Such was their desperation to board a flight out of Kabul that they arrived despite public warnings that the airport was a possible target of the Islamic State.\n\nHere are portraits of a few of them:\n\nALI REZA AHMADI\n\nAli Reza Ahmadi, 36, had fled the Taliban before. When the group first seized Kabul in 1996, he escaped as a child to Iran, where he grew up as a refugee and graduated from high school.

In fact, he's been more late-game clutch than overall dominant, even in winning four Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nHere is our ranking of his first nine Super Bowl performances:\n\n1. Super Bowl LI: Patriots 34, Falcons 28 (2016)\n\nIt was on pace to be Brady's worst Super Bowl in the third quarter, when the Patriots trailed 28-3 and the quarterback's most noteworthy play was throwing a pick-six. But he orchestrated the biggest Super Bowl comeback in the first one ever to go to overtime by completing 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBrady completed third-down passes to three different receivers on the game-tying 91-yard touchdown drive \u2014 then capped it with a must-have 2-point conversion pass. The halftime adjustment to target 1-on-1 coverage outside the numbers was brilliant.\n\n2. Super Bowl XLIX: Patriots 28, Seahawks 24 (2014)\n\nYou remember Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception, but did you forget the Patriots' 10-point fourth-quarter comeback?\n\nUndeterred by the dark cloud of Deflategate and an unthinkable decade-long championship drought, Brady was 37-of-50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns with two interceptions. But he was 13-of-15 for 124 yards with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the NFL's top-ranked defense, anchored by its secondary.\n\n3. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 (2017)\n\nLike the only other quarterback ever to throw for 500 yards in the playoffs \u2014 Ben Roethlisberger, three weeks ago \u2014 Brady lost. Unlike Roethlisberger, Brady wasn't piling up meaningless stats.\n\nBrady took shots down the field in completing 28-of-48 passes for 505 yards \u2014 including 237 yards while throwing under pressure \u2014 and three touchdowns with no interceptions.

And it came at a time when she will provide Democrats the edge with her tiebreaking vote.\n\nHarris' ascent to the vice presidency, combined with the swearing-in of her appointed Senate replacement, Alex Padilla of California, and newly elected Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, made New York's Charles E. Schumer the Senate majority leader.\n\nLike President Joe Biden when he was vice president, Harris will have a variety of largely ceremonial functions as president of the Senate, but she may also find herself doing something Biden never did.\n\nThe 50-50 party split in the Senate puts her in a somewhat similar position to her most recent predecessor, Mike Pence, who was on the West Front of the Capitol for Wednesday's inaugural ceremony. He cast 13 tiebreaking votes over his four-year term, in part because of recent changes in Senate rules on nominations.\n\nHarris' new tiebreaking power also led to Vermont Democrat Patrick J. Leahy resuming the position of Senate president pro tempore, with the constitutional role to fulfill the Senate duties of the vice president when she is not in the Capitol.\n\nIn their opening floor statements following Leahy's election, which came by unanimous consent, both Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Biden and Harris and praised the celebration of democracy that took place Wednesday. But neither spoke to the details of the effort to formally organize the Senate, which is the most pressing piece of business.\n\nSchumer and McConnell continue to iron out the terms of the amount of power to be provided the minority party. Any agreement will likely echo the 2001 deal that resulted from the last time the Senate was tied: Democrats will chair committees and Schumer will have control of the floor, but there will be equal membership on committees.\n\n\"This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic and bold. And to my Republican colleagues, when and where we can, the Democratic majority will strive to make this important work bipartisan,\" Schumer said on the floor.\n\n\"Our country deserves for both sides, both parties, to find common ground for the common good everywhere that we can and disagree respectfully where we must,\" McConnell said in his first speech since returning to minority leader status. \"Last fall, the American people chose to elect a narrowly divided House of Representatives, a 50-50 Senate and a president who promised unity.\"\n\nFor those looking for signs of such bipartisanship, there was one Wednesday. The chamber, even without a formal organizing resolution, confirmed Biden's nominee to be director of national intelligence, Avril Haines.\n\nThe 84-10 vote came after a brief hiccup when Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., placed a hold on the nomination until he received a response regarding comments Haines made during her confirmation hearing Tuesday."}

Trump faces a single count of incitement of insurrection for the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol where lawmakers were in the process of certifying the Electoral College results from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAll nine of the Democratic managers are lawyers and all are new to the role, having not served as managers in the first impeachment trial of Trump in 2019, when the Senate acquitted the former president for obstruction of justice and abuse of power arising from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate then-candidate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland\n\nRaskin, 58, is leading the prosecution. He spent more than 25 years teaching constitutional law at American University and has also served as a Maryland state senator. A member of the House Judiciary Committee, Raskin was also involved in the deliberations over Trump's first impeachment in 2019. The lawmaker's 25-year-old son died by suicide just a week before the January 6 riot at the Capitol. Raskin said he decided to take on the role as lead House impeachment manager because \"I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020 and my country and my republic in 2021.\"\n\nRep. Diana DeGette of Colorado\n\nDeGette, 63, has been in Congress since 1997 and was previously a civil rights lawyer and also served two terms in the Colorado House.

David Cicilline of Rhode Island\n\nCicilline, 59, has been in Congress for over a decade and is a former Washington city public defender, a former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and a former lawmaker in that state. He is only the fourth openly gay person to be elected to Congress. A member of the Judiciary Committee, he was involved in deliberations over Trump's previous impeachment and this year helped to write the articles of impeachment."}

I responded as politely as I could that Trump continues to heave himself almost daily into the news with false claims about a \"rigged\" presidential election and with ongoing attacks on the free press and even on members of his own party.\n\nHad I waited a few days to respond to the email, I would have included an excellent example of Trump's ongoing lack of common decency when he issued a tasteless statement following the death of statesman and trail-blazing military hero Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nPowell, 84, a longtime Republican who became a Trump critic, died Oct. 18 of COVID-19, amid a battle with cancer.\n\nShowing his usual lack of class, Trump said the following: \"Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media. Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO (Republican in name only), if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell was in stark contrast to the well-deserved praise Powell received from various political leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. Trump can hope all he wants, but he was such a horrible president I'm certain neither the legitimate news media nor historians will treat him \"beautifully\" after he dies.\n\nAlso, as he often does, Trump was really speaking about himself when he accused Powell of attacking other Republicans. Trump has trashed a long hit list of Republican leaders over the years, including former President George W. Bush, former House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's one-time Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and his Vice President Mike Pence, who wouldn't kowtow to Trump's blatant attempt to steal the election.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has insulted a hero. Remember when he belittled Arizona Sen. John McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam? Trump said McCain, who died in 2018, was no hero because he got captured. Remember when news outlets reported that Trump called America's heroic war dead \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nTrump is no match for Powell \u2013 intellectually, as a patriot or a human being. Powell served in the Army for 35 years. He was a Vietnam veteran, a four-star general, and the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He was secretary of state under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.\n\nTrump is a draft dodger, failed businessman with multiple company bankruptcies, and a grifter who has conned millions of people into believing he is their political savior. Trump continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from supporters who believe his lies that Democrats cheated him out of the presidency. Even his statement disparaging Powell included a request for money.\n\nPowell was man enough to regret his role in the invasion of Iraq, calling it a blot on his record. He considered the weapons of mass destruction fiasco \"one of the worst intelligence failures in U.S. history.\" Contrast that to Trump's refusal to take responsibility for anything negative that occurred during his presidency, including his administration's poor handling of the COVID-19 epidemic that so far has killed 750,000 Americans."}

On Tuesday, Portland Public Schools also had to issue lockdowns and lockouts for three schools after a student allegedly robbed another with a weapon off campus, then came to school. Lebanon High School also was locked down, and South Albany High School had a false report of threat, as reported by the Albany Democrat-Herald.\n\n\"We've spoken to many, many parents this week who are concerned about this across the region,\" said Kraig Sproles, superintendent of the Bethel School District. \"What we're seeing is a lot of our students either hearing about a threat or mentioning it themselves. And we need to take that really seriously.\"\n\nIt's not surprising there were more threat concerns on the heels of Nov. 30 shooting in Michigan, Sproles said, as people often are more anxious following a violent act at schools involving guns.\n\n\"So I think that's part of it, but I also just think it's at a time when we as a society are a little bit more on edge and less resilient than we normally would be,\" he said.\n\nBethel had three separate incidents that were reported to staff last week, he said. One was regarding a text back-and-forth between two students in conflict. Another was a student conversation that involved a gun.\n\nSproles said they took care of that second incident, \"but then it kind of took on a life of its own on social media.\"\n\nSupporting students: How parents can help students cope with Oxford school shooting\n\nThe third was regarding a Willamette High School student who said they had a gun at school, prompting students to alert staff and have a brief lockdown Tuesday. When Eugene police responded and searched the student, no weapon was found. The student purported to have a gun and was carrying \"another object\" that could give the appearance of a gun, Eugene police spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin said Wednesday. The student was arrested for disorderly conduct in the first degree.\n\nSproles said in each instance, students brought their concerns to an adult they trusted, which is exactly what they should do.\n\nAfter hearing a student's concerns, Bethel staff are then prompted by their emergency training to take proper action depending on the situation.\n\n\"There's a chart in every single room that teachers and other staff can use to get the step-by-step information of what to do in an emergency,\" Bethel spokesperson Alisha Dodds said. \"So regardless of the emergency, they have that information at hand.\"\n\nBethel also has training for an active threat called ALICE, a protocol used in schools across the nation, which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate.\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe biggest thing the recent incidents revealed for the district, though, was it needs to work out a better way of communicating with families in these situations.\n\n\"We need better communication with parents, in both communication during an event, and then communication immediately following an event, and in a time when most high school students have cellphones, they are texting their parents or communicating with their parents or community during an emergency totally different than they have in the past,\" Sproles said.\n\nSetbacks: Latest Oregon report card shows school enrollment declines, setbacks for some students to graduation\n\nInaccurate or incomplete information can easily be spread this way or via social media, and the district isn't always able to match that immediacy in the moment. To improve on this, the district is planning on holding a meeting with Willamette High parents this week, with the central topic of how to better work together.\n\n\"I think for parents, we need a little bit of feedback on the communication they expect during an emergency and what we can commit to providing,\" Sproles said.\n\nStudents also will be having more focused conversations about the incidents in homeroom."}

It also studied whether political content from news organisations was amplified on Twitter, focusing primarily on US news sources such as Fox News, the New York Times and BuzzFeed.\n\nThe study compared Twitter's \"Home\" timeline \u2013 the default way its 200 million users are served tweets, in which an algorithm tailors what users see \u2013 with the traditional chronological timeline where the most recent tweets are ranked first.\n\nThe research found that in six out of seven countries, apart from Germany, tweets from rightwing politicians received more amplification from the algorithm than those from the left; right-leaning news organisations were more amplified than those on the left; and generally politicians' tweets were more amplified by an algorithmic timeline than by the chronological timeline.\n\nAccording to a 27-page research document, Twitter found a \"statistically significant difference favouring the political right wing\" in all the countries except Germany. Under the research, a value of 0% meant tweets reached the same number of users on the algorithm-tailored timeline as on its chronological counterpart, whereas a value of 100% meant tweets achieved double the reach. On this basis, the most powerful discrepancy between right and left was in Canada (Liberals 43%; Conservatives 167%), followed by the UK (Labour 112%; Conservatives 176%). Even excluding top government officials, the results were similar, the document said.\n\nTwitter said it wasn't clear why its Home timeline produced these results and indicated that it may now need to change its algorithm. A blog post by Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering, and Luca Belli, a Twitter researcher, said the findings could be \"problematic\" and that more study needed to be done. The post acknowledged that it was concerning if certain tweets received preferential treatment not as a result of the way in which users interacted, but because of the inbuilt way the algorithm works.\n\n\"Algorithmic amplification is problematic if there is preferential treatment as a function of how the algorithm is constructed versus the interactions people have with it. Further root cause analysis is required in order to determine what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm,\" the post said."}

Some Americans were horrified by the images of a teenager toting a powerful semiautomatic rifle on a city street during racial justice demonstrations, a reminder of the extent of open carry laws in the United States.

Gavin Newsom of California, said the verdict served as a message to \"armed vigilantes\" that \"you can break the law, carry around weapons built for a military, shoot and kill people, and get away with it.\"\n\nPresident Biden said the acquittal would \"leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included,\" but he also urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. \"I stand by what the jury has concluded,\" he told reporters earlier. \"The jury system works, and we have to abide by it.\"\n\nRepublicans, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said that \"justice has been served.\" Rebecca Kleefisch, the leading Republican candidate for Wisconsin governor, said that \"the justice system worked\" and called the prosecution \"a complete disgrace.\"\n\nShortly after noon on Friday, the jury forewoman, wearing a jean jacket and a face mask, handed the verdicts to a court official, who passed them to Judge Bruce Schroeder for review. As the verdict was read, Mr. Rittenhouse's mother and sisters cried, and friends and family of the men Mr. Rittenhouse fatally shot clutched each other's hands and wept. Several jurors, appearing fatigued, shifted uncomfortably in their seats or folded their arms across their chests.\n\nOutside the courthouse, quiet gave way to shouts from supporters of Mr. Rittenhouse.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The attack Friday by multiple suicide bombers hit a Shiite mosque in the southern city of Kandahar during midday prayers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but a similar attack in Kunduz last Friday was claimed by the Islamic State.\n\nTaliban police commander Abdul Ghafar Mohammadi said the blasts killed more than 50 and wounded at least 100, and he said he expected the toll to rise as health workers recovered more bodies.\n\nMany \"dead bodies remain under the ruined mosque,\" Hafiz Abdul Hai Abbas, health director for the province, told The Washington Post earlier in the day.\n\nMany fear recent attacks demonstrate that the Taliban \u2014 which took over Afghanistan two months ago \u2014 is unable to curb other militant and terrorist groups, especially in urban areas. Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State remain active in Afghanistan, and if they grow in power under Taliban rule, the country could again become a haven for those intent on launching international attacks.\n\nLast Friday's suicide bombing in Kunduz was claimed by the Islamic State's Afghanistan branch. The blast struck a crowded Shiite mosque during Friday prayers, killing nearly 50 worshipers and wounding dozens more. The Sunni extremist Islamic State considers Shiite Muslims to be heretics and often targets their places of worship.\n\nThe Islamic State also claimed responsibility for an attack Thursday that killed a Taliban police chief in the eastern province of Konar, according to local media reports.\n\nThe Taliban's ability to maintain tight security in territory under its control has been a core source of its popularity. Now in control of the entire country, the movement is under immense pressure to extend similar protections nationwide. Taliban leadership condemned Friday's attack as \"a big crime\" and ordered the movement's fighters to arrest those behind it.\n\nEyewitnesses told The Post that they heard multiple explosions from the mosque.\n\n\"First, I heard gunfire and then explosions followed,\" said Abdul Jabar Karimi, 40, who was near the blasts. \"Blood was everywhere.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Khaledi, 26, said he saw as many as four suicide bombers \u2014 two who detonated their bombs near the mosque's entrance, and two who set off their bombs inside the building.\n\n\"Everyone is shocked. Shiites in Kandahar were never attacked before,\" Khaledi said.\n\nFootage from inside the mosque showed several bloodied bodies on the floor, some covered in sheets, while onlookers wailed. The Taliban said it had sent its elite forces to the site to investigate.\n\nBut Kandahar is not a part of the country that has seen significant Islamic State activity previously. The province is the Taliban's historic heartland, and has great symbolic value and a rural population that has traditionally supported the militants.\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan also condemned the attack on what it said was Kandahar's largest Shiite mosque. The U.N. statement put the number of dead at 30.\n\n\"Those responsible need to be held to account,\" the mission tweeted."}

Images showed the ship's bow was touching the eastern wall, while its stern looked lodged against the western wall \u2014 an extraordinary event that experts said they had never heard of happening before in the canal's 150-year history.\n\nTugboats strained Wednesday to try to nudge the obstruction out of the way as ships hoping to enter the waterway began lining up in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. But it remained unclear when the route, through which around 10% of world trade flows and which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil, would reopen. One official warned it could take at least two days. In the meantime, there were concerns that idling ships could become targets for attacks.\n\n\"The Suez Canal will not spare any efforts to ensure the restoration of navigation and to serve the movement of global trade,\" vowed Lt. Gen. Ossama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nBernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given, said all 20 members of the crew were safe and that there had been \"no reports of injuries or pollution.\"\n\nThe refloating operation was temporarily suspended late Wednesday and will be resumed early Thursday, according to canal service provider Leth Agencies.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the ship to become wedged on Tuesday morning. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experienced a blackout without elaborating.\n\nBernhard Schulte, however, denied the ship ever lost power.\n\nEvergreen Marine Corp., a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea but none of its containers had sunk.\n\nAn Egyptian official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief journalists, similarly blamed a strong wind. Egyptian forecasters said high winds and a sandstorm plagued the area Tuesday, with winds gusting as much as 50 kph (30 mph).\n\nHowever, it remained unclear how winds of that speed alone would have been able to push a fully laden vessel weighing some 220,000 tons."}

They had come to hear Rennie Davis, then 32 and one of the most admired antiwar activists in the country, talk about changing the world. Davis was nothing short of a celebrity. Two years earlier, he helped organize the massive May Day protests against the Vietnam War, and in 1969, he and six men, who would come to be known as the Chicago Seven, were charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot outside the Democratic National Convention. Davis was one of only two defendants to testify during the raucous, highly publicized trial, which featured a parade of colorful characters, including an unhinged judge and the defense witnesses Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary.\n\nDavis was known for being even-tempered and a relentless organizer, but he combined his seriousness of purpose with charisma and an infectious optimism. While he's portrayed in the 2020 Aaron Sorkin film \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\" as a nerd who \"couldn't sell water to a thirsty man in the desert,\" as his fellow 1960s activist Frank Joyce put it to me, Davis was actually one of the antiwar movement's most captivating speakers.\n\nDavis would need those skills in Berkeley, where he had come to deliver a stunning message: Activism, he now believed, had failed to fix a broken country. The new solution \u2014 to war, poverty, racism \u2014 was spiritual enlightenment. \"I'm really blissed out with a capital 'B,'\" Davis told the crowd. \"We are operating under a new leadership, and it is divine. It's literally going to transform this planet into what we've always hoped and dreamed for.\"\n\nThe \"new leadership\" had an unlikely frontman: a car-obsessed 15-year-old Indian named Guru Maharaj Ji, dubbed the \"perfect master.\" (Writers and activists who struggled to understand his appeal preferred to call him other things, including \"the fat kid\" and \"the paunchy preadolescent mystical magnate.\") Maharaj Ji, who now goes by Prem Rawat, was one of countless gurus who gained popularity in the West at the time; the teenager's organization, called Divine Light Mission, had an estimated 50,000 followers along with hundreds of centers and ashrams across the United States. Acting as both devotee and spokesman, Davis insisted Maharaj Ji would bring peace to the world. \"God is now on this planet,\" he announced during a radio interview.\n\nDavis's message was catnip to Maharaj Ji's followers in Berkeley, who danced and placed Easter lilies next to a picture of the boy on a linen-draped altar. But then came the catcalls. \"We kept you out of jail, we came to Chicago, and now what are you doing to us?\" someone yelled at Davis. \"Kiss my lotus ass,\" another sneered. Activists with \"fury bleeding out of every wound,\" as one writer put it then, hurled tomatoes at their former idol. A homeless man \u2014 or prophet, one couldn't be sure \u2014 interrupted Davis with cheeky Buddhist riddles."}

The teen became a hero in Republican corners and a symbol to the left of the rise of white nationalism and armed militia groups.\n\nRittenhouse, 18, fatally shot two men and injured a third with an AR-15 styled rifle during often violent protests in the summer of 2020 following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse argued he feared for his life and had no choice but to open fire on the men, who were among those protesting.

For almost 10 years, he told his family he wanted to cut it down, but he couldn't afford the expense of a tree-cutting service.\n\nOn Sunday night, as Hurricane Ida started shredding its way through southeast Louisiana, the tree crashed down in his front yard and killed him. It crushed the top of a white truck that Duplessis had just stepped out of on the passenger side, and a broken branch severed an artery in his leg.\n\nThe storm had already knocked out power in the neighborhood. He never saw the tree falling in the total darkness and cascading rain surrounding him.\n\nDuplessis' nephew, Caleb Marcantel, was in the driver's seat and pinned in the truck by the tree. Despite all odds, he climbed out with only a wound to his hand. He ran across the street to get his sister-in-law, a nurse, to help his uncle who was now bleeding out on the driveway.\n\nCrystal Marcantel rushed outside with Caleb to put pressure on the leg while sustained winds of 115 miles per hour roared around them. She tried to stop the bleeding, but she knew the situation was dire. While comforted by his family members, Dennis Duplessis recited the Lord's Prayer, and then uttered his final words \u2013 a message to his wife of more than 40 years.\n\n\"Tell Hope that I love her,\" he said, according to his daughter. He passed away within minutes and before paramedics could arrive.\n\nDuplessis, 60, was the first confirmed fatality in the devastating storm system that's now killed dozens and left millions without power, water, or access to essential needs in the scorching summer heat. The storm left a path of destruction across a large portion of the United States, from Louisiana to New York.\n\n\"He always said he'd give his last breath for (his wife), and he wanted to go before her,\" said Duplessis' daughter, Chasity Fatherree. \"He was out here trying to hook up the generator for her. And he went before her.\"\n\nFour days after his death, Fatherree stood in her father's driveway while volunteers from nearby churches sawed away at the nearly giant tree that's still laying in their front yard, a reminder of the tragic accident that unfolded earlier this week.\n\n\"He hated that tree,\" Fatherree said.\n\n\"The what-ifs and the timing is all I can think about,\" she added. \"I close my eyes and I just see the tree hitting him. It's just, it's horrible \u2013 the tree that he hated.\"\n\nNo one expected the storm to carry so much strength as it moved inland from the gulf. By the time the storm hit Gonzales, which is about 67 miles northwest of New Orleans, it was still a Category 3 hurricane, after initially making landfall as a Category 4.\n\nWhile Gonzales and the larger Baton Rouge area were spared the same devastation that struck other parts of Southeast Louisiana, it still tore down power lines and trees. In Ascension Parish, which includes Gonzales, nearly 26,000 customers were still without power as of Friday night, five days after the hurricane.\n\nHistoric church built by freed slaves is badly damaged\n\nStorms like Ida change lives. The damage can't be measured solely by the physical destruction; storms also take symbols of the past.\n\nNearly 40 miles southeast of Gonzales, the Whitney Plantation in Edgard has become a historic museum that focuses on the experience of enslaved Africans. Joy Banner is a descendent of enslaved people and now works as the museum's communications director.\n\nShe lives in the area and sought shelter Sunday night in the plantation's mansion, which was built in 1791 by her ancestors. When the sun rose the next morning, she walked out to find the big house and the slave's former cabins were largely spared, but the historic church built by freed slaves after Emancipation was badly damaged. Some structures, like a century-old barn, were completely flattened. The beautiful white picket fence around the property was barely standing.\n\nJoy Banner, the communications director at Whitney Plantation and a descendent of enslaved Africans, shows some of the damage to a church that was built by freed slaves on the plantation, which is now a museum. Ashley Killough/CNN\n\n\"It was such a sinking feeling in my heart,\" she said. \"Just walking around and seeing some of our buildings did collapse, seeing some of the trees and debris all over the site...There was lots of tears. It was such a surreal experience.\"\n\nBanner said she believes much of the damage is restorable, but it could take months before they can reopen."}

We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\n\nOver the past few weeks \u2014 I know you're \u2014 many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it \u2014 we've been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K \u2014 an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened \u2014 has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.\n\nThis is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\n\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed \u2014 this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack.

We will continue the evacuation.\n\nI've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.\n\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there.

Powell remained preoccupied with fixing things. The former secretary of state and four-star general tinkered endlessly in his garage \u2014 sometimes with his welder and sometimes on a succession of early Volvos, which were less complicated than the Corvette he used to whiz around the Beltway. (He took the Corvette to a track to race against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his Stingray in the fall of 2016. \"You want a head start?\" Powell goaded Biden. \"Go ahead.\") He was a regular at the neighborhood hardware store in McLean, Va., where he rummaged through parts for his house's malfunctioning dishwasher or leaky faucets.\n\nHis plywood-and-wire fixes often left something to be desired aesthetically. But they satisfied his native frugality, his curiosity about how things worked and, perhaps above all, his compulsion to repair rather than discard what was broken. When he was fixing things, his longtime friend and deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage said, \"there was a result at the end of the day. It's why he was so happy as an Army officer: You take a platoon, and you make it better.\"\n\nAt Powell's memorial service in November, his son, Michael, recalled the time in 1982 when his father, then stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, bought a pallet of defective adding machines from a government surplus auction so that he could take each of them apart and make them work again. He did not mention that his father's career at the time had hit a brick wall, after receiving a lackluster annual efficiency report. Then and later, Powell refused to blame racism for the matter, though he might have had cause to suspect it. His Jamaican parents had taught him that the way to overcome bigotry was to \"get over it and be better than them,\" as Michael Powell recently told me.\n\nHe did: A decade later, Colin Powell was a four-star general, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably the most admired man in America. His swift ascent seemed to personify the military strategy that came to be known as the Powell doctrine: Establish precise goals, exhaust all diplomatic options, amass support from allies and the public, then defeat the adversary with overwhelming force.\n\nBoth the general and his doctrine became famous during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, an invasion of such brutal efficiency that it lasted all of 100 hours. The victory would not save the presidency of Powell's friend and political benefactor George H.W. Bush. Yet Powell also seemed well suited to the center-left boomer triumphalism of Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, whom Powell served for eight months of the new president's first term. After all, Powell's persona offered the tantalizing prospect of America moving past the two defining fault lines of the 1960s: race and Vietnam.\n\nAfter Powell stepped down, Republicans swooned over the idea of the Black general as their standard-bearer. He and his wife, Alma, eventually decided that a life of electoral politics would not be to their liking. But he was still the most popular political figure in America five years later, when George W. Bush, in his first cabinet appointment, named Powell secretary of state.\n\nBy the beginning of 2003, Powell was faced with a problem that seemed beyond his ability to fix: the commander in chief was determined to go to war with Iraq, hastily and with threadbare support from America's allies. Such a ground invasion flew in the face of the Powell doctrine. Alone among the members of Bush's war council, the secretary of state enumerated to the president the many things that could go disastrously wrong. Still, when Bush asked in January 2003, \"Are you with me on this?\" Powell assured him that he was.\n\n\"What choice did I have?\" Powell told me a decade and a half later. \"He's the president.\" His decision reflected a career built on prevailing from inside the system, ever aware that quitting was exactly what the critics and bigots wanted to see him do. For once, however, the supremely self-confident Powell failed to appreciate his leverage with the American public. Had he resigned in protest, the likely succession of events might well have forestalled the war.\n\n\"They call me the reluctant warrior,\" Powell told me, \"but if you want to go to war, I know how to do it.\" Bush tasked Powell not with overseeing the war but instead selling it to the public. The secretary's infamous speech to the United Nations on Feb. 5, 2003, with its multitude of claims about Saddam Hussein's illicit weapons program that would later be proved false, amounted to an indelible stain on an otherwise remarkable career of public service.\n\nPowell later matter-of-factly described the U.N. speech to his son as the biggest mistake of his career. But he refused to denigrate his former commander in chief \u2014 who, after all, had delegated the burden of that speech to the one man in America who had the credibility to deliver it."}

In the latter role, he oversaw the US invasion of Panama and later the US invasion of Kuwait to oust the Iraqi army in 1991.\n\n\"General Colin L. Powell, former U.S. Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid 19. He was fully vaccinated,\" his family said in a statement on Facebook.\n\n\"We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American.\"\n\nPowell's family did not address whether he had any underlying illnesses, but his aide Peggy Cifrino confirmed he had been battling multiple myeloma.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what complications he suffered or how long Powell had been in the hospital prior to his death.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, Alma Powell, and their three children.\n\nPowell was also the first black secretary of state during President George W. Bush's first term from 2001 to 2005.\n\nHis reputation suffered a painful setback in 2003 when he delivered a speech to the United Nations Security Council to make the case that the US should go to war against Iraq.\n\nHe later admitted his speech was rife with inaccuracies and false intelligence that claimed there was evidence Iraq and Saddam Hussein were hiding weapons of mass destruction.\n\nPowell resigned in 2005 and later referred to his UN speech as a \"blot\" that would forever tarnish his record.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir \"It Worked for Me,\" Powell wrote: \"I am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me.\n\n\"It was by no means my first, but it was one of my most momentous failures, the one with the widest-ranging impact.\"\n\nHe added: \"The event will earn a prominent paragraph in my obituary.\"\n\nBush was among those to lead the tributes for Powell, saying he was \"highly respected at home and abroad.\"\n\n\"He was a great public servant starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam. Many presidents relied on General Powell's counsel and experience. He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2014 twice,\" Bush said in a statement.\n\n\"He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I sent Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life of a great man.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden hailed Powell as a patriot who broke down racial barriers and \"embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.\"\n\n\"Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity. From his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation's policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else \u2014 in uniform and out \u2014 and it earned him the universal respect of the American people,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\n\"Above all, Colin was my friend.

His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\"\n\nFloyd had hypertensive heart disease, Baker said, \"meaning his heart weighed more than it should.\" This meant Floyd's heart needed more oxygen than a normal heart and was \"limited in its ability\" to provide more oxygen when there was a demand for it.\n\nIn the midst of an altercation and being held to the ground, adrenaline would pour into the body, Baker said, making the heart beat faster.\n\n\"In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions,\" he said.\n\nChauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died as a result of drugs and preexisting health conditions. And under cross examination, Baker said he believed those factors played a role.\n\n\"So in your opinion,\" Nelson asked, \"both the heart disease as well as the history of hypertension and the drugs that were in his system played a role in Mr. Floyd's death?\"\n\n\"In my opinion, yes,\" Baker said.\n\nBut Baker reiterated he stood by the cause of death he wrote on Floyd's death certificate and his finding Floyd's death was a homicide, which to a medical examiner means his death was caused by another person and does not necessarily indicate guilt."}

Phil Murphy said 23 people \"lost their life to this storm,\" about half of them in Central Jersey. Most died after becoming trapped in vehicles that were overtaken by floodwaters.\n\nThe death toll rose to 25 overnight, Murphy said Friday morning on the \"Today Show.\" Six people were still missing, he said.\n\nAsked if the number of fatalities could rise, Murphy said, \"Sadly, likely yes.\"\n\nAs it stands, though, Ida is the deadliest storm since Sandy struck in 2012. Tallies vary, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the death toll in that storm at 34.\n\nNJ rainfall totals: How much rain did North Jersey get from Tropical Storm Ida?\n\nDid storm flood your home?: How to file an insurance claim for flood or storm damage to your NJ home\n\nAt least 45 people died nationwide in Ida, most of them concentrated in New Jersey and New York.\n\nCentral Jersey appears to have been the deadliest region in New Jersey, with at least eight fatalities.\n\nIn North Jersey, at least three people were killed.\n\nIn Passaic, a man was killed after floodwaters engulfed the car he was in. A Bloomfield resident died while trying to hook something up outside during the storm. A man was also found dead in Maplewood after his wife reported him missing during the storm. Police believe he may have been swept away by flood waters.\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nSandy and other storms\n\nSandy is the modern benchmark for destruction. But a year before, Tropical Storm Irene flooded parts of New Jersey and claimed the lives of at least 10 people, according to news reports.\n\nWith Ida, intense rain and tornadoes wreaked a new level of havoc.\n\nNo storm in recent history claimed as many lives as Ida, Sandy or Irene, seeming to bolster the message of Murphy and other elected Democrats that climate change is taking a more frequent and extreme toll on humanity.\n\n\"This is just yet another reminder these things are coming more frequently, they're more intense \u2014 sadly, more deadly,\" Murphy said on \"Good Morning America\" Thursday.\n\nNew Jersey's location, surrounded by water on both sides, and its dense population makes it particularly susceptible to destruction. But the three recent storms \u2014 all within the last decade \u2014 seem to underline Murphy's point.\n\nThe governor declined on Thursday to provide details about the deaths from Ida, but he and other public officials spent the day making the case for enhancing the country's infrastructure to try and limit the damage from future storms.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of storms may have played a role in Ida, Murphy said. Many areas were still saturated from Tropical Storm Henri less than two weeks ago, he said, leading to severe flooding."}

Morris, Mich., that has sold door locks to 300 school districts in Michigan and about 10,000 districts across the country.\n\n\"It's not a lock until it needs to be, it's a piece of hardware that mounts to the door and another piece that mounts to the floor. The locking device is a red handle that lives in a wallbox on the wall beside the door,'' said Cris Ahearn, director of sales for Nightlock.\n\nIn the event of a lockdown or a drill, the box is opened, the red handle removed. One end is slid into a slot into the door; the other end fits into a notch in a metal plate mounted on the floor.\n\n\"If a classroom door has glass ... and the perpetrator tries to break the glass and reach in and turn the handle to gain entry into the room, they can't do that because the door is locked at the floor,'' Ahearn said.\n\nOxford started installing the locks in 2017, according to Nightlock records. One version installed works on doors that swing outward or inward. Another version works on outward swinging doors which most classroom doors are. Oxford had a mix of both locks at the high school and districtwide.\n\nThe locks average about $50 per door.\n\nThe alleged shooter never entered a classroom during the shooting spree that killed four students and wounded six more students and a teacher on Tuesday, Nov. 30.\n\nThose killed and wounded were fired upon in the hallways.\n\n\"The first thing I thought of was at least they have our locks. Then we're watching it unfold at our computers and at first they were saying no loss of life and we were relieved. Then we found out that was not the case,'' Ahearn said. \"For the whole emotional week we've gone through I keep thinking about how do you lock down the hallways? We can provide safe rooms in every office and every classroom, but if you're in the hallway, then you're exposed and it's tragic.''\n\nOakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard reviewed the crime scene last week and credited Oxford Community Schools with taking safety precautions.\n\n\"There is an extensive camera system thanks to the proactive work of Oxford schools. ... Our liaison taught them ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate),'' Bouchard said. \"Desks were upturned, doors were barricaded, doors were actually hit by gunfire and so were barricades. But the doors were safe, so that behavior, that training, those protocols saved lives.''\n\nOn Friday and Monday, the phone were ringing at Nightlock's offices.\n\n\"It's not the reason you want the phone to ring, our hearts are broken and devastated. I have friends who have kids that go to that school. It's tragic,'' Ahearn said.\n\n\"A lot of districts are trying to harden their facilities,'' Ahearn said.\n\nNightlock started making residential locks to prevent home invasions after the owners' parents home was broken into while their mom was there. They came up with a residential lock as a hobby and sold it on the internet. They ran their father's steel company full-time.\n\nThen came the 26 deaths in 2021\u2014 including 20 children \u2014 at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\"After Sandy Hook, teachers started calling, they wanted these devices for their classrooms but that (residential) device doesn't meet code as far classroom for egress,'' Ahearn said. \"So the lockdown device was designed based on a collaboration with school administrators and code officials to come up with something that is safe and effective. We've been doing that since 2012, since Sandy Hook.\"\n\nShe said in the past week they've received an outpouring of emails and social media posts from parents and children thanking them that the school had the locks."}

The UK media abides by the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Code of Conduct 'to avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's race', as well as by rigorous defamation laws. And rightly so \u2013 the British press doesn't always get it right. But social media is the Wild West by comparison, publishing vile slurs on a daily basis with impunity.\n\nSome therefore find it strange that such a litigious couple would claim to have been 'silenced' when they have made so many complaints, including resorting to legal action, over stories they claim not to have even read. There is something similarly contradictory about a couple accusing the tabloids of lacking self-reflection while refusing to take any blame at all \u2013 for anything.\n\nIn any normal world, informed writing on such matters would be classed as fair comment, but not, seemingly, on Twitter where those completely lacking any objectivity whatsoever are only too willing to virtue signal and manoeuvre.\n\nAs the trolling reached fever pitch in the aftermath of the interview, veteran royal reporter Robert Jobson of the Evening Standard called me. 'Don't respond to these freaks,' he advised. 'It's getting nasty out there. Watch your back!'\n\nYet despite my general sense of bewilderment at the menacing Megbots, I can't say it didn't appal me to discover a close friend had received online abuse, purely by dint of being my mate. After discussing the lengths the troll must have gone to to track her down, she asked me, 'Do you ever worry someone might do something awful to you?' Er, not until now, no.\n\nOf course it's upsetting, even for a cynical old-timer like me. Worse still are people who actually know me casting aspersions on my profession on social media. Often these are the same charlatans who would think nothing of sidling up to me for the latest gossip on the Royal family, while publicly pretending that reading any such coverage is completely beneath them.\n\nMost pernicious of all though \u2013 not least after Piers Morgan's departure from Good Morning Britain following a complaint to ITV and Ofcom from the Duchess \u2013 is the corrosive effect this whole hullabaloo is having on freedom of speech. When you've got a former actor effectively editing a British breakfast show from an \u00a311 million Montecito mansion, what next?\n\nI cannot help but think we are in danger of setting race relations back 30 years if people are seriously suggesting that any criticism of Meghan is racially motivated. It's the hypocrisy that gets me. When Priti Patel was accused of bullying, the very same people who willingly hung the Home Secretary out to dry are now the ones defending Meghan against such claims, saying they have been levelled at her simply because she is 'a strong woman of colour'.\n\nOf course journalists should take responsibility for everything they report and be held to account for it \u2013 but Harry and Meghan do not have a monopoly on the truth simply because the close friend and neighbour who interviewed them in return for \u00a37 million from CBS took what they said as gospel."}

Here's Why\n\nEditorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nNow that the third round of pandemic relief stimulus checks has been long spent, you might wonder if there's any potential for a fourth round of payments.\n\nIn short, no. However, a few states have opted to issue payments of their own.\n\nLawmakers instead are focusing on other measures to provide financial support, like child tax credit payments.\n\nDirect payments and other pandemic relief programs have been shown to curb housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. Without them, it's likely the economic recovery after the early pandemic recession in spring 2020 would move even slower than the gradual progress it's been making for the last year and a half.\n\nBut although some members of Congress have previously called for additional aid for households still weathering the financial effects of the pandemic, there have not been meaningful discussions at the federal level about issuing another round of checks.\n\nWhat States Are Sending New Stimulus Checks?\n\nMany states have either sent, or are sending, stimulus checks to qualifying residents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn July, California announced the Golden Gate Stimulus deal to provide a payment to 5.7 million people. Taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year can receive one-time payments of $600, and households with dependents can receive an additional $500. Distribution of those payments began in September.\n\nNew York\n\nIn April, New York started offering one-time payments of up to $15,000 for undocumented immigrants who couldn't work due to the pandemic. Applications are considered in the order received, and the state has cautioned that the fund is nearly empty.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew Mexico announced one-time payments of $750 to more than 4,000 low-income households that didn't receive federal stimulus payments. Applications for this program are no longer accepted, and payments were issued in early August.\n\nMaryland\n\nIn Maryland, taxpayers with qualifying income could receive up to $500. Those payments were authorized and processed in February 2021.\n\nColorado\n\nIn Colorado, anyone who received unemployment benefits between March and October 2020 automatically received a one-time payment of $375.\n\nOther State Programs\n\nOther states have chosen to send direct payments to certain groups of frontline workers. Some teachers in Georgia and Florida received payments in 2021; in Minnesota, those receiving bonus checks included grocery store workers and medical center staffers.\n\nIn some cases, additional direct payments have come from state budgets: California's, for one, was funded by a surplus in state income tax revenue. Other state programs have used federal pandemic aid to distribute money to residents directly.\n\nIs Congress Calling for a Fourth Stimulus Payment?\n\nDiscussion on Capitol Hill about issuing additional stimulus payments has quieted since the spring.\n\nIn late March, a group of more than 20 Democratic senators signed a letter to Biden asking for additional aid for Americans. The group recommended recurring direct payments instead of a one-time check."}

The docuseries is co-produced by ESPN, Religion of Sports, 199 Productions, and NFL Films.\n\n\"Tom Brady has been a dominant force in the NFL, and in the broader culture, for two decades now. No player in recent memory has been more analyzed or debated, more beloved or reviled,\" said director Gotham Chopra. \"Man in the Arena is an examination of his impact on and off the field, and I'm eager for that discussion to continue around the series.\"\n\nAdded Brian Lockhart, senior vice president, ESPN+ Original Content and ESPN Films: \"Tom Brady went from being selected 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft to leading one of the greatest dynasties in sports, and he still isn't done.

If we don't protect our data, it is wide open for our competitors to steal or manipulate and to disrupt our military operations,\" he said.\n\nKendall is not the only defense official concerned with the department's vulnerability to cyber attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Air Force Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost pointed to the Colonial Pipeline hack as an example of the \"growing threat\" of cyber attacks and said cybersecurity would be one of her top priorities as the new head of US Transportation Command.\n\n\"If you can imagine a cyber criminal ... can cause fuel prices to rise, what could a persistent threat \u2014 a persistent and very capable threat \u2014 do to our systems?\" she asked the audience at NDTA.\n\nWhile the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline did not directly assault military networks or other infrastructure, the event raised questions about the safety of networks used by commercial companies that form a key part of the Defense Department's logistics backbone.\n\nThe department relies on commercial vendors for gas, jet fuel, and the transportation of goods and people \u2014 all critical commodities for TRANSCOM, which uses military assets to move troops and supplies but also contracts directly with industry for additional airlift, sea freight transportation and other delivery services.\n\nAny disruption to the department's commercial vendors or its supply chain \u2014 or more widely, to the military's own infrastructure \u2014 could be devastating in a war, Kendall said.\n\n\"Our adversaries can be assumed to be able to disrupt our networks right now, because we have not sufficiently guarded against an attack,\" Kendall said. \"Fewer than half of trucking and logistics companies even have a chief information security officer. What does that mean for our supply chain?\"\n\nBefore being sworn in as Air Force secretary, Kendall spoke with the House Armed Services Committee's task force on supply chain resilience and tried to convey the importance of ensuring the security of the defense industrial base and logistics enterprise, he said.\n\n\"Peacetime supply chain disruptions and shortages were a problem certainly, but a manageable one,\" he said. \"Wartime disruptions and shortages, on the other hand, could be much more problematic and in fact decisive.\"\n\nThe Pentagon will need more funding in order to help mitigate current logistics vulnerabilities, Kendall said. Specifically, the military needs more weapons storage facilities and hardened fuel storage infrastructure, and it also needs to ensure that the commercial transportation industry can recruit talented employees.\n\n\"We must also acquire more resilient transportation systems of systems,\" he said. \"We know our current capabilities are vulnerable to cyber and kinetic attacks. We must address that harsh reality by incorporating the certainties of offensive cyber and kinetic attacks into our military requirements and into our acquisition plans.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's nominee for director of operational test and evaluation (DOT&E) also signaled on Tuesday that the department may need to do more to ensure its own weapons and equipment can stand up to cyber attacks."}

For years, the president has used his Twitter account to reach his nearly 90 million now-former followers on the platform as a means to bypass traditional media. Many critics have long argued that Twitter should take a firmer stance against Trump due to his dangerous use of the platform to spread lies and violent rhetoric.\n\nWhile some may see the move as too little, too late, and Trump's supporters are questioning it entirely, it nevertheless marks a historic exertion of Twitter's ability to influence politics during a time when the strength of democracy in the US is being seriously tested.\n\n\"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,\" read a company blog post on Friday explaining the decision. Despite the fact that Twitter has generally allowed world leaders like Trump to post more controversial content than the average user since their tweets are deemed newsworthy, the company said that these accounts are still \"not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.\"\n\nAhead of the permanent ban, Twitter had previously temporarily suspended Trump's tweets on Wednesday for violating its policies on civic integrity and violence, and warned that it may permanently suspend him if he continued to violate its policies. Now, users can no longer see Trump's tweets, and the president is unable to post on his account.\n\nThe move comes as hundreds of Twitter's own employees urged CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump permanently, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nThe day before Twitter's permanent suspension, Facebook blocked Trump's account on its platform, which has tens of millions of followers, from posting and emphasized that the ban would be in place for at least two weeks until President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nRecent events leading to the decision\n\nTwitter's official explanation for why it permanently blocked Trump's account was that his last two tweets violated the company's Glorification of Violence policy and were part of a broader pattern of encouraging violence during the transition of presidential powers. Twitter specifically cited a concern that Trump's followers seemed to interpret his announcement about not attending Biden's inauguration as a signal that it would be a \"safe\" target for violent acts.\n\nThe first tweet that pushed Trump past Twitter's tipping point stated that he would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration. The second declared that the \"75,000,000 great American Patriots\" who voted for Trump would not be \"disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\""}

Try as you might however, you won't find that needed renewal by what you read in the media \u2014 the Fourth Estate \u2014 as the American press is not your partner in restoring your faith in America, its sacred institutions or its people. Instead, the media are pot-stirrers of the first order and shameless instigators of division.\n\nAs found in a recent Reuters Institute Poll, the United States press ranks last in media trust, at 29 percent, which is about seven points lower than Joe Biden's present approval rating, indicating just how low the press can go.\n\nNowhere was this lack of trust more magnified than in the media's reporting of the State of Wisconsin vs. Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nIf you truly believed all of the amalgamated press on the Kyle Rittenhouse case prior to the presentation of a somewhat important thing called \"evidence\" at an \"actual trial\", you might have been led to believe that: Kyle Rittenhouse was a white supremacist/domestic terrorist who carried an illegal rifle across state lines to Kenosha, WI, a place upon which he had no ties, to murder two black men and recklessly and without cause, injure a third man during an otherwise peaceful, non-violent civil protest on Aug. 25, 2020.\n\nWell, at least part of that above scenario is true; Kyle Rittenhouse was in Kenosha on Aug. 25. The rest was simply a false narrative pushed by an irresponsible media.\n\nNo evidence existed that Rittenhouse believed in the superiority of the white race and as was the case with Loudon County Virginia parents (complaining to their school board over CRT instruction and same-sex bathrooms) there equally was zero evidence to label Mr. Rittenhouse a domestic terrorist.\n\nMoreover, he did not carry a rifle across state lines and it was not illegal for him to possess that rifle under Wisconsin Law which is made infinitely clear by photos, post verdict, of a 16 year old black female carrying a similar rifle in Kenosha while providing security for those protesting the Rittenhouse verdict."}

Rittenhouse faced five charges and was found not guilty on all of them.\n\n\"Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life...hell he would've had his life taken before the bullshit trial.. sad,\" Wallace said in a tweet shortly after the verdict.\n\nRittenhouse's trial has divided the country, largely along partisan lines, with conservatives praising the jury's decision and liberals condemning the decision.\n\n\"Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,\" Karen Bloom and John Huber, the parents of Anthony Huber, who was killed by Rittenhouse, said in a statement.\n\n\"We hope that decent people will join us in forcefully rejecting that message and demanding more of our laws, our officials, and our justice system,\" they added.\n\nConcerns of violent protests erupting have swirled as people for and against Kyle Rittenhouse have been at a standoff outside the courtroom for days while the trial proceeded.\n\n\"I believe justice has been served in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. I hope everyone can accept the verdict, remain peaceful, and let the community of Kenosha heal and rebuild,\" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) tweeted Friday."}

But a worker at outsourcing mega-org Wipro accidentally checked the wrong combination of on-screen boxes, leading to the repayment of not only the interest but also the $894m (\u00a3640m) principal from the bank's funds.\n\nCitibank has a \"six-eyes\" policy on massive money transfers of this type. In the Revlon fiasco, a Wipro worker in India configured the transfer using software called Flexcube, his local manager approved it, and Vincent Fratta \u2013 a Citibank senior manager based in Delaware, USA \u2013 gave the final OK for the transfer of funds, all believing the settings were correct.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the transfer set up by the first Wipro worker. He should have ticked not just the principal field but also the front and fund fields, and set their values to the necessary clearing account number. By leaving those two boxes unchecked and values empty \u2013 and wrongly assuming just putting the account number in the principal field was a correct move \u2013 the entire principal of the loan, which was set to mature in 2023, was handed back to 315 creditors.\n\nIncomplete ...

Source: US courts system\n\nIt wasn't until the next day that staff noticed the error, and sent out emails asking for the funds be returned \u2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars were. However, a group of 10 creditors refused to hand back their share the cash, amounting to more than $500m, leading Citibank to sue them in New York to recover the dosh.\n\nThis week, the US federal district court judge presiding over that lawsuit sided with the lenders, saying [PDF] they had reasonable grounds to think that the transfer was legitimate and that they had legal grounds to keep their money.\n\n\"The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,\" Judge Jesse Furman ruled.\n\n\"Indeed, to believe otherwise \u2014 to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1bn \u2014 would have been borderline irrational.\"\n\nSince the amount sent back repaid the loaned amounts to the cent and no more, the judge ruled Citibank had no right to reclaim the money.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" Benjamin Finestone, representing two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners, told CNN."}
